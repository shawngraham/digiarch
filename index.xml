      <description>Nota bene: There is no midterm. There is no final exam. Each week, there are tasks for you to attempt. Sometimes there is a choice of which tasks to do; in those cases, I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for the number of these that you complete, but that you push yourself out of your comfort level. What&amp;rsquo;s more, it&amp;rsquo;s OK if something doesn&amp;rsquo;t work &amp;lsquo;perfectly.&amp;rsquo; The reflection on the process, both your fails and your successes, is the important thing.</description>

      <description>Questions I developed this course with a couple of questions in mind, things I wanted to know the answers to. Digital archaeology - what the hell is it, anyway? What is it for? Is it just a &amp;lsquo;follower&amp;rsquo;, repurposing other tools &amp;amp; techniques, a supporting skill for &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; archaeology? Let&amp;rsquo;s set ourselves a grand challenges: what can digital archaeology be?&#xA;This course is a formalized exploration of these questions; I do not know the answers!</description>

      <description>The Most Important Idea Archaeology isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily about the past. It&amp;rsquo;s about the materiality of the past and present and in many ways, the future. We try to understand what it is to be human through the extended abilities that tool use, that objects and their agencies, give to us. The digital tools we use are entangled with and extend humanity in powerful ways - and in 2025, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how digital technologies have extended humanity&amp;rsquo;s worst impulses.</description>

      <description>Each week, I will lay out goals for things I want you to pay attention to, I will give you something to listen to, and I will give you things to read, and things to do.&#xA;Goals for this week This week is about getting set up and situated, including using a custom platform I have built for note-making. You might already have a system you use for making notes and keeping track of things, which is good.</description>
