        <description>If any of the instructions below are unclear, annotate this page with hypothesis while being logged into our course reading group. If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation. Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. &amp;lsquo;Git&amp;rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state.</description>

        <description>While watching this video, turn on the closed captions.
Create an account at hypothes.is:
Get the Chrome app or the Firefox bookmarklet:
Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re logged in:
Then join our HIST3000|CLCV3000 reading group. If you happen to be reading something, and see an existing annotation that interests you, hit the &amp;lsquo;reply&amp;rsquo; button on the annotation to start a conversation! Sometimes, the person to whom you&amp;rsquo;re replying might be a previous year&amp;rsquo;s student, but that&amp;rsquo;s ok; they might enter into conversation with you.</description>

        <title>Setting up your Zotero</title>
        <link>https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/1/zotero/</link>

        <description>Zotero is a piece of software for managing your research. When it is installed, it can extract metadata from websites or pdfs (when these have metadata) and store the information in your very own library. Zotero can be connected to Word or Google Docs so that when it is time to insert a reference, you can select the reference from your library - and then get the machine to automatically format/update your bibliography against whatever citation style you use.</description>

        <description>Notes and Emergent Ideas In recent years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that a lot of my research materials are all online. Everything I read, everything I study. I use Zotero to handle bibliography and to push pdfs to an iPad with zotfile; then I annotate as I read on the device, and eventually, retrieve the annotations back into Zotero.
I read on a browser on my work computer too; I use hypothes.is with a private group where I&amp;rsquo;m the only member to annotate websites and pdfs when I can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to send them to the ipad.</description>

        <description>Help! Things have gone wrong! Montparnasse Derailment, 1895
Things are going to go wrong. Things are going to break. Instructions will seem vague or incomplete - or worse, I will have indeed forgotten to tell you something crucial.
Or worse, I&amp;rsquo;ve made an assumption about your understanding, and left things unsaid that needed to be made explicit. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of this, in the digital world, in fact.
This week, you learned a bit about Git and Github.</description>
