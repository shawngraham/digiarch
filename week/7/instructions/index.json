Go further with a gentle introduction to Spatial Archaeology  With tech work, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come together in about 30 minutes, it won\u0026rsquo;t come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear that you laboured heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.\r Speaking of another pair of eyes - in any of the computational binders or notebooks I provide, there is a feature to start a private video chat. Please do not feel that you have to do this on your own. Make use of that! When you click on it, it\u0026rsquo;ll give you a code. Share that with people in this class (or friends outside the class who might be able to help). Work on this stuff together. Just make sure to acknowledge all and any collaboration.\nIf a binder loads you up directly into RStudio, you can get to the Jupyter screen by copying the url to a new tab in your browser, and then deleting the last bit of the url, the /rstudio/ bit. This is handy because you can also select any files you create for download here, and of course, start up the video chat.\nRecord and Reflect You may make your repository private or public.\nIf you make it private, make sure to \u0026lsquo;invite user shawngraham\u0026rsquo; to your repository so that I may view it.

Are there differences in who gets commemorated, and how? Were there aspects of the work that affected you emotionally? Why? Do the 3d models have an affective aura? Why or why not? In what ways does mapping the graveyard give you authority and power? Begin the reflection by quoting (w/ citation) one sentence from the readings that resonates with you: you don\u0026rsquo;t have to explain why, but you might select something that is personally meaningful, or leaves you confused, or makes you happy, or intrigues you to know more\u0026hellip; etc. Put your journal entry in your repo.\n  Log Your Work You can log the link to your repository on this form.\n","description":"Field work and ethical data collection II","id":0,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"M1 Wk3: Instructions","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/3/instructions/"},{"content":"Module 1: Capturing/Creating Getting Started \nGoals for this week  getting our Github accounts set up and making our first log entries getting Hypothes.is set up getting Zotero installed getting Obsidian set up understanding what the hang you\u0026rsquo;ve signed up for getting a sense of what digital archaeology is; also, \u0026lsquo;failing gloriously\u0026rsquo;  Listen  Feed for the podcast here.

Use the 3 w\u0026rsquo;s: what is ‘weird’ (eg, unfamiliar to your experience or expectations), ‘wonderful’ (eg, makes you see your studies in a new or exciting way), or ‘worrying’ (eg, something that seems problematic to you)\n  Log your reflection in your appropriate github repository\n  When/if you run into trouble, take screenshots (google how to do that for your particular machine) and these can be uploaded into your repository as well. Indeed, you should also keep track of any files you create as part of your weekly work in your repo: these are evidence!\n  With tech work, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come together in about 30 minutes, it won\u0026rsquo;t come in an hour.

(See the Github instructions for a reminder.)\n  Being a digital archaeologist means keeping track of what you’ve done, as a gift to your future self (ie, so that when you come back to something, you can pick up where you left off). Make a new text document, and put into it any new terms you’ve encountered, commands you used, error messages you encountered, websites that helped, and so on: this document is a lab notebook, as it were. Bullet points and memos-to-self are fine. Put this text document into your week one repo on github, along with any other files or digital things you happen to make. Call it your ‘notes.md’.\n  In a new text document, jot down some reflections - narrative, or bullet points, whatever works for you; both are fine. Call it ‘journal-week-1.md’ This document also goes into your week one repo on github.\n  Begin the reflection by quoting (w/ citation) one sentence from the readings that resonates with you: you don\u0026rsquo;t have to explain why, but you might select something that is personally meaningful, or leaves you confused, or makes you happy, or intrigues you to know more\u0026hellip; etc.\nIn this document, you will detail any issues you had with getting started, any parts that caused you difficulty, anything you annotated that you really want me to address for you. If you got any error messages while trying to get set up, copy those into your reflection; google them. Do you find any websites that help you? What kind of ‘failures’ might you have encountered this week?\nGoing beyond the mere mechanical aspects of getting started, draw on your annotations of what you’ve read (and/or your notes from what you’ve listened to), discuss your idea of what ‘digital archaeology\u0026rsquo; might be prior to starting this course, and think through whether any of the materials we’ve seen this week confirm or upset those notions. What kind of archaeology have you encountered so far at Carleton, if at all? Where do you want to go, with digital archaeology?\nLog Your Work You can log the link to your repository on this form.\nPS If you missed it in the syllabus, this spreadsheet can be used to keep track of what\u0026rsquo;s due when.\n","description":"Module 1: Capturing/Creating","id":1,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"M1 Wk1: Instructions","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/1/instructions/"},{"content":"Field work and ethical data collection Goals for this week  Find a local historic graveyard (current graveyard is OK) Begin recording some gravestones Create a rough map of the site  Listen  Feed for the podcast here.

For instance, you might want to share photos of what you\u0026rsquo;re doing in the Discord server to ask others what they think of a particular grave monument, how they might code it in our system.

One of the advantages of scripting or writing out your analysis as a sequence of commands is that anyone can look at your code and understand what you did and why it worked.\n Launch a virtual computer running RStudio in your browser by right-clicking on this link. nb If no one has launched this virtual computer in a while, it can take several minutes to launch; but once someone else has launched it once, it\u0026rsquo;ll be faster for the rest of us.  Because this a virtual computer running on someone else\u0026rsquo;s computer, it will time out after around 10 minutes inactivity. Save and when you are ready to download your work to your own machine, replace the part of the URL that says /rstudio/ in the address bar with /tree/; the virtual computer\u0026rsquo;s file manager will display. Tick off the box beside the file you wish to save, and hit \u0026lsquo;download\u0026rsquo;. You can go back to rstudio by changing the URL back to /rstudio/\r The interface for RStudio looks like this:  Create a new script:   The script that you want can be found at this link. Open the link in a new tab, and then copy it into the script window in R Studio. Put the cursor at the top of the file at the start of the line. You can then run each line by hitting the \u0026lsquo;run\u0026rsquo; button, or by using the keyboard shortcut (cmd+enter or shift+enter). Read the comments (which are marked with a # sign) and follow all instructions.\n  Going further: Try Kevin Gartski\u0026rsquo;s tutorial on visualizing archaeological data here. You can copy and paste that code directly into a new script in R (click on the \u0026lsquo;raw\u0026rsquo; button on github, then copy all the text, paste into the R script window).\n  ","description":"An Introduction to R and Statistics","id":9,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Basic Stats in R","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/5/basic-r-stats/"},{"content":"In the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook Environment, look at section 2.4 on databases; then start up the binder in a new tab by right-clicking this link.

Epoiesen - A Journal for Creative Engagement in History and Archaeology has published a number of pieces that use a wide variety of modes to tell the story, from photo essays to time lapse art to papercraft.\nFor this exercise, I want you to scratch that creative itch. I\u0026rsquo;m open to just about anything; if you have some sort of art or media practice you\u0026rsquo;d like to employ, by all means, go ahead. If however you\u0026rsquo;re a bit like me - I\u0026rsquo;m all thumbs - you might want a bit of support. Below are two suggestions and supporting materials.\nAs you design and implement your piece, keep notes or \u0026lsquo;paradata\u0026rsquo; on what you\u0026rsquo;re doing and why - make explicit connections with the readings. The pieces on Epoiesen can serve as models for paradata.\nThe theme of your piece: a creative engagement with the graveyard project, and your work on that material.\nTwo suggestions: sonification, or photo-essay. I may add more supporting materials.\nSonification Gravestone inscriptions frequently mention the data. If we represented our class graveyard data in sound, what patterns might we hear? What might those patterns reflect in the lived experiences of those communities? Use this binder and adapt the code in the \u0026lsquo;intro to sonification\u0026rsquo; notebook to represent your gravestone data. Then, you may download the .midi files and use something like Garageband or other music editing software to assign instrumentation, or remix as appropriate. A piece I made with Eric Kansa and Andrew Reinhard, \u0026lsquo;Reflexivity\u0026rsquo; actually used a web app called Two Tone to generate the original soundlines (we then remixed). You can give TwoTone a play around as well.\nPhoto Essay A photoessay can be put together using a static gh-pages site (which you learned about last week); simply add photos and work your narrative around them. But if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for more of a challenge, exposé is a site generator that will take a folder of images and turn it into a website; you then upload all of the generated files (and images) to a new repository. In the new repository, go to \u0026lsquo;settings\u0026rsquo; and under \u0026lsquo;gh-pages\u0026rsquo; set the branch to serve from as \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo;.\n  You will need to install ImageMagick; scroll on that page until you find the version that matches your computer. Mac users will need to install homebrew first in order to follow the ImageMagick installation instructions.\n  Once you get ImageMagick installed, download exposé and unzip it.\n  Create a working folder on your machine. (Right click in your file explorer or finder and create new folder).\n  Move your image folder into that folder (ie, your image folder is now a subfolder).\n  Start a command prompt in your folder (PC: in the address bar in your file explorer, you can click and then type cmd. Hit enter. A black window will open; this is the command prompt.) Mac users - from Applications search for or select \u0026lsquo;terminal\u0026rsquo;. Then, look at the path to your folder in finder. In the terminal, type cd path\\to\\your\\workfolder and hit enter.\n  We now want to tell your computer where the expose.sh command is - remember, it\u0026rsquo;s in that folder you downloaded from github. Take a look at the path to where it is, and then, at the command prompt, type alias expose=/script/location/expose.sh where everything after the = sign is the path or location of the expose.sh file.\n  Now let\u0026rsquo;s build a photoessay! At the command prompt, cd imagefolder where \u0026lsquo;imagefolder\u0026rsquo; is the name of the subfolder with all of your images. Then, at the prompt: expose. Boom!\n  Now the text for your images: make text files for each image. If the image is \u0026lsquo;sunny-day.png\u0026rsquo;, the associated text should be in \u0026lsquo;sunny-day.txt\u0026rsquo;. To control the order, change the names to have numbers at the start, eg \u0026lsquo;05-sunny-dat.txt\u0026rsquo;. (Names will be sorted alphabetically).\n  Examine the resulting folder.\n  Step.works Stepworks is a newish service that uses the idea of the \u0026lsquo;single tap\u0026rsquo; as the interaction that moves you through a multi-media piece; in its own words, \u0026ldquo;Stepworks turns just about anything into an embeddable digital instrument you can perform with clicks, taps, or keypresses. All you need is Google Sheets.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea is that each column in a spreadsheet can be a kind of \u0026lsquo;voice\u0026rsquo;, while each row is what should happen on a subsequent tap. Spreadsheets then get loaded into a \u0026lsquo;stage\u0026rsquo; that has different kinds of interactions or layouts. One looks like a text message screen; another can handle a kind of splitscreen effect (it reminds me of the opening to any Marvel movie, when the big \u0026lsquo;MARVEL\u0026rsquo; logo appears).\nNow, it\u0026rsquo;s still in beta, so there are some rough edges; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to use https (just plain ol\u0026rsquo; http) so you might get some security warnings. If you do, and your browser just doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to play with it, then you might as well stop because it\u0026rsquo;s not something that we, on our end, can fix.\nBut if it does work for you, I find that tapping with the space bar works best once you\u0026rsquo;re looking at something.\n  Create a new google spreadsheet by copying this one to your account.\n  You can add some more characters just by putting their name at the top of the columns, one name to one column.\n  Your sheet can get complicated; you can mix in videos and other multimedia, as in the image below, if the stage you choose to use accepts that.\n   When you\u0026rsquo;re ready, go to \u0026lsquo;file\u0026rsquo; and hit \u0026lsquo;publish to the web\u0026rsquo;. Accept whatever it says. Then, don\u0026rsquo;t copy the url that the pop up gives you. Dismiss the pop up, and then copy the url in your address bar.\n  Go to https://step.works/index.php/stage and select the kind of stage you want to use.\n  Hit the \u0026lsquo;load\u0026rsquo; button, and then select \u0026lsquo;google sheets\u0026rsquo; and paste the url in there.\n   Do you see that button \u0026lsquo;notes\u0026rsquo; at the bottom? If you click on that, special commands that you can enter to customize your work for the particular affordances of a particular stage will appear. Not every stage will display all of the same material. So do check those \u0026lsquo;notes\u0026rsquo; as you develop.\n  Every stage\u0026rsquo;s url is constructed the same way. That means you can try the different stages, and just paste in the bit from the ?sheets= onwards (from the ? on!) after the url to the stage, eg:\n  See what you can come up with, and share the link (you could try embedding it in your github repo for this week too).  ","description":"On Creative Engagement","id":11,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Digital Creativity","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/11/creativity/"},{"content":"Introduction Photogrammetry is the process whereby multiple photographs of an object are stitched together to make a 3d model of the object; the photographs are then draped over the model to make it photorealistic. Because of the physics of photography (focal distances of lenses and so on) a computer can calculate the relative positioning of overlapping points it identifies in multiple photographs, and with a bit of trig it works out the points-in-space. Then it joins these points up by connecting to the nearest neighbouring points, creating a series of triangles or \u0026lsquo;mesh\u0026rsquo;.\nA common digital format then for these models is a folder with a .obj file describing the geometry of the object, a .png file with all of the texture information, and a .mtl file that tells the computer how to drape the texture onto the model. Services like sketchfab.com let you upload a zip file of such a folder, and then display or annotate the object. Here\u0026rsquo;s one I did of a gravestone of one of the Moodie family burials:\n Gravestone2 by electricarchaeo on Sketchfab  Getting Started   Read the small section on photogrammetry in ODATE\n  Select one of the gravestones in the cemetery that you are working on. If that\u0026rsquo;s not possible, you can try making a model of an object in your house.\n  If you have an actual digital camera, use that. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, your cell phone camera can work. You will need to take photos of all sides of the stone/object such that you have sufficient overlap of each image. Around 20 photographs can do it. You might circle the object three times, once at a low level, once at the middle, and once around the top (if feasible).\n Transfer your photographs to a folder on your computer; if you have a google drive account, you might want to move them there.\n  An actual digital camera embeds metadata about focal length in each image that the photogrammetry process will use. Most cellphone cameras do not. If you are using cellphone images, please follow these instructions to embed metadata into your images.\n  Making a 3d model You have two options here.\n  Use Google\u0026rsquo;s own computing resources to stitch a model together for you with a piece of software called \u0026lsquo;Meshroom\u0026rsquo;. To do this, right-click and open this notebook in a new window. You run each cell in that notebook starting at the top - select the cell, then hit run. When it finishes, select the next cell, and hit run. That notebook has instructions on uploading your images directly, or connecting to your google drive folder. Read carefully before hitting run! The process might take a bit of time.\n  Download and use Regard3d, an open source collection of algorithms for making 3d models, on your own computer. Download Regard3 and then follow its tutorial; you can then re-do its steps on the folder of your own images. Remember: you need to add the metadata to your photos if the camera you used isn\u0026rsquo;t a standard camera; see Getting Started Step 4.\n  Then, once you\u0026rsquo;re done:\n  Upload your finished model to Sketchfab.com; the free version only allows 1 upload per month. Another option is https://p3d.in; models there can only be max 100 mb in size. There are other options too that you can find with a bit of googling. It might well be that your model is quite wonky - perhaps you didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough photos in the right places. How is the process of taking photographs similar to the kind of close reading you might do in a history class?\n  You can also drag and drop your model files (.obj, .mtl, .png) into your github repo for this week (zipped file is ok too).\n  ","description":"Creating 3d Models from Photographs","id":12,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Photogrammetry","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/3/photogrammetry/"},{"content":"Consolidation Pause I Goals for this week  Use this time to catch up on anything you didn\u0026rsquo;t read, to try some of the exercises over again, and to consolidate what you\u0026rsquo;ve achieved so far.

There are digital archaeologies that focus on the work in the field, towards ever better practices and data collection. There are digital archaeologies that try to upend our notions of what it means to publish archaeological work. There are digital archaeologies that aim to immerse us in the past. This is not an exhaustive list.\nThe fact is, the digital extends our cognition in ways - for good and for ill - that we still are only in the opening stages of grappling with. The fundamental action of a computer is to copy, and so the choices we make when we render something computable have unforeseen and often unintended consequences when these choices scale up and multiply. When we use computation and digital tools in archaeology, the tool is making us even as we use it to make an understanding of the past/present.\nI want therefore to extend an invitation to you to explore these issues further. There are a variety of ways you might do this. Perhaps you explore these issues in your coursework in other classes. Perhaps you apply to my X-Lab. Perhaps you apply for the Graham Undergraduate Digital History Research Fellowship. I have supervised undergraduate Honours research projects (HIST4910, 1.0 credit) in the past on the historical consciousness of Dwarf Fortress, and on Bronze Age feasting (using network analysis) - just to give you an idea of the range of things I\u0026rsquo;m prepared to support. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of grad school and want to bounce some ideas around. If any of this sort of thing sparks your interest, then let\u0026rsquo;s talk. I\u0026rsquo;m open to ideas. We might not have an archaeology degree at Carleton, but archaeological ways of knowing can be explored many ways.\n","description":"Your Own Digital Archaeology","id":14,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"An Invitation","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/12-5/an-invitation/"},{"content":"Introduction Humans have made virtual worlds since time immemorial (see, for instance, Lascaux). Hadrian\u0026rsquo;s Villa at Tivoli was a virtual world. Disney World is a virtual world. Online is a virtual world but it\u0026rsquo;s still the real world.\nAs this map put together by Andrew Reinhard and I suggests, there are a lot of dimensions to archaeogaming. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s still on Netflix, but the \u0026lsquo;Atari: Game Over\u0026rsquo; documentary is worth a look because it is a case of quite literal archaeology of video games.\nMost of the time, no one excavates physical video games. But we do do work inside video games, and archaeologists do sometimes help design video games - Tara Copplestone, in \u0026lsquo;Designing and Developing a Playful Past in Video Games\u0026rsquo; has written on the tension between good archaeology and good game design, and it\u0026rsquo;s well worth your time to read.\nFor my money, a video game does one thing really well: it teaches the player how to play it. If you\u0026rsquo;re really good at the game, you\u0026rsquo;ve internalized its representation of the world. And that\u0026rsquo;s why archaeologists need to think about storytelling, and ethics, and representation in video games. (More from me along this vein in this article.)\nBut there are other ways of approaching the worlds created in video games as archaeological spaces. This week, I\u0026rsquo;ll suggest four options.\nOption 1: Graves and memorialization in-world Here, I want you to select a game that you know well that includes within it graveyards or other memorials to the dead. Off the top of my head, I could imagine Dwarf Fortress, Dragon Age Inquisition, Witcher, or the Assassins\u0026rsquo; Creed franchise. And then I want you to record gravestones and other monuments in the game, using our KoboToolBox recording system that we used for the Graveyard Project.\n(This work is not without precedent; see the archaeological survey of worlds in the No Man\u0026rsquo;s Sky universe; there was even a code of ethics developed to guide that research.\nBut, but\u0026hellip; games aren\u0026rsquo;t real worlds! What good would it be to study memorialization in there?\nVirtual worlds are still human worlds, and the way death is memorialized in there might also provide us insight to how we construct death out here. Archaeology isn\u0026rsquo;t just about the past, remember. We spend a great deal of our waking hours in these virtual worlds. Perhaps studying memorialization in-world will give us insight into memorializations of the future? Perhaps it might tell us about how people form social relationships in-world? Let\u0026rsquo;s find out.\nGo into the game, and take screenshots. Then, working from your screenshots, record them in our system. Think about, and record, the ways memorialization is constructed in these games, and how it is similar/different from the \u0026lsquo;real world\u0026rsquo; data.\nOption 2: Craft a \u0026lsquo;barely\u0026rsquo; game Rob MacDougall introduced me to the idea of \u0026lsquo;barely games\u0026rsquo; years ago. With this option, I want you to devise a \u0026lsquo;barely game\u0026rsquo; that could be played with our graveyards data.\nThis is for the entirely practical reason that designing and building games takes a lot of time and effort. Thus, your game might -\n be built in Twine; there are many tutorials on how to achieve different effects with Twine; you might start with the Twine Cookbook be built with Bitsy something else that you know of that I haven\u0026rsquo;t encountered. Key thing is: this has to be something achievable in a few days.  Option 3: Game Design Document Another possibility is to sketch out a game design document for something a little bit more complex than a barely game, but certainly not as complex as a first person shooter. Maybe a deck builder? Something where the main gameplay maps onto the ways digital arcaheology looks at the world. (templates abound online; here\u0026rsquo;s one). I emphasize again: sketch. Focus on aesthetics and gameplay. Key element: it must use the information collected by this class.\nOption 4: Investigate a Landscape Go play Nothing Beside Remains.

Augmented and virtual realities were always a part of the scene, in the stuff I read. I\u0026rsquo;ve spent a lot of time over the past ten years or so trying to bring those visions to life, given the level of my tech chops and the available technologies I had to play with, with various degrees of success. I shelled out for an Oculus Rift SDK v2, put it on, plumbed it into Minecraft, and promptly had to lie down for three hours because my head went one way and my body went the other.\nI get motion sick. VR just doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for me. But AR - and other kinds of \u0026lsquo;mixed\u0026rsquo; realities - seems to me to hold out much more promise. When I have gone field walking with accomplished landscape archaeologists, they see so much more than I do, because they know how to read the landscape, and their imaginations, training, and knowledge come together to build up a vision of the space that is far more full than what I can see. Stu Eve wrote his PhD thesis using augmented reality to understand the Bronze Age landscapes of Bodmin Moor, and his work is fascinating; well worth checking out. That work used early iPads as a kind of hand-held window into the past. Hand-held AR - well, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me motion sick, and if we think of these devices as opening magic windows (link is to a mixed reality demo by the Emotive Project)\u0026hellip; I can get behind that.\nA few years ago I wrote\n The thing about hand-held AR is that you have to account for why. Why this device? Why are you looking through it at a page, or a bill board, or a magazine, or what-have-you? It’s not at all natural. The various Cardboard-like viewers out there are a step up, in that they free the hands (and with the see-through camera, feel more Geordi LaForge).\n  [\u0026hellip;] Without the story, it’s just gee-whiz look at what I can do. It’s somehow not authentic. That’s one of the reasons various museum apps that employ AR tricks haven’t really taken off I think. The corollary of this (and I’m just thinking out loud here) is that AR can’t be divorced from the tools and techniques of game based storytelling (narrative/ludology, whatever).\n I can teach you the technical elements of putting together a simple augmented reality web-app. But the storytelling, the framing, the \u0026lsquo;why am I doing this with my phone\u0026rsquo; - that\u0026rsquo;s the harder part. In this exercise then, I want you to reuse the 3d model you built in week 3 and put it into physical space. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use a tool called AR.js that delivers AR via html. (Other options are possible - Unity for instance can be used to make both location based and image-based AR).\nSome terms: Location based AR: your device reads your position in physical space and overlays \u0026lsquo;assets\u0026rsquo; (3d models, audio, video, text) tied to those spaces\nMarker based AR: your device recognizes a marker graphic (like a QR code) and overlays the assets on that marker\nImage based AR: your device recognizes distinct images (paintings, photos, logos, etc) and overlays the assets tied to that image (here\u0026rsquo;s ane example from MoMA; here\u0026rsquo;s an example by public history grad students at Carleton).\nLocation Based Ar with a 3d Model There are many tutorials out there on using AR.js. We\u0026rsquo;re going to do a modified version of these:\nAkash Kuttappa, 2017\nNicolò Carpignoli, 2019.\nAnd the quickstart from AR.js itself.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to build a website that you load up on your phone, and which will then read your location and put the 3d model of one of your gravestones into that space. What kind of \u0026lsquo;story\u0026rsquo; will you write to make that action \u0026lsquo;sensible\u0026rsquo; or inevitable or entirely reasonable? What story do you tell to make it compelling to do this?\nSetting things up   Download your 3d model from Sketchfab in gltf format. This will give you a zipped folder; unzip it.\n  Create a new public repository on github for this exercise; initialize it with a readme file. Call the repo ar-demo.\n  Drag and drop the unzipped folder for your model into the repo. Commit your changes.\n  Create a new file in that repo and call it index.html. nb This file lives at the same level as your readme.md file, not inside your model folder.\n  Building your webpage Now, because we\u0026rsquo;re using a web based technology, we have to load the various scripts that we\u0026rsquo;re going to use. We do that inside the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tag of the webpage, like so:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta http-equiv=\u0026#34;X-UA-Compatible\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;IE=edge\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;HIST3000 AR demo\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://aframe.io/releases/1.0.4/aframe.min.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://unpkg.com/aframe-look-at-component@0.8.0/dist/aframe-look-at-component.min.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar-nft.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt;   Those three \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tags tell your browser to reach out and grab the javascript packages that will enable the augmented reality. Commit your changes.\n Find the location you wish to augment in decimal degrees. I sometimes use Google Earth to do this. If you go to Google Earth, and search a location, the latitude and longitude will turn up in your URL. For instance, if I wanted to augment the centre of the Quad at Carleton University, I would search for Carleton U in Google Earth, and then zoom in until I had the quad in the centre of the screen (double clicking in the middle to make sure). This URL https://earth.google.com/web/search/carleton+university/@45.3823833,-75.69885509,72.33333211a,51.2940786d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CigiJgokCUUI4Yny6j5AEbHSDo4ACjlAGfM35yrZKEzAIVBSUjKtRVHA shows you exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m looking at. The bit I want is the bit after carleton+university/@, or 45.3823833, -75.69885509. Copy that somewhere safe.\n  Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to build the \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;. If you committed your changes back in step 5, you need to hit the \u0026lsquo;edit\u0026rsquo; button. We\u0026rsquo;ll set up a basic opening  tag: \u0026lt;body style=\u0026quot;margin: 0; overflow: hidden;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n  Now we\u0026rsquo;ll start defining some of the AR.js tags that will deliver us some augmented reality. We open and define an  tag:\n  1 2 3 4  \u0026lt;a-scene vr-mode-ui=\u0026#34;enabled: false\u0026#34; embedded arjs=\u0026#39;sourceType: webcam; sourceWidth:1280; sourceHeight:960; displayWidth: 1280; displayHeight: 960; debugUIEnabled: false;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;    The next bit tells the camera to be aware of rotation: \u0026lt;a-camera gps-camera rotation-reader\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a-camera\u0026gt;\n  And now we tell it the location of our 3d model, and where to pin it to the world:\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  \u0026lt;a-entity gltf-model=\u0026#34;gravestone3/scene.gltf\u0026#34; rotation=\u0026#34;0 180 0\u0026#34; scale=\u0026#34;0.15 0.15 0.15\u0026#34; gps-entity-place=\u0026#34;latitude: 45.3823833; longitude: -75.69885509;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a-entity\u0026gt;   Where I have gravestone3/scene.gltf you\u0026rsquo;ll have the folder name for your model. The rotation and scale elements define how the model will look in the physical space.\nNow we just close the open tags:  1 2 3  \u0026lt;/a-scene\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;   \u0026hellip;and commit our changes. One last element: we have to tell Github to serve this page up on the web. Go to the cogwheel \u0026lsquo;settings\u0026rsquo; icon and scroll down to Github Pages. Under the drop down under \u0026lsquo;Source\u0026rsquo; select \u0026lsquo;Master\u0026rsquo;. Github will build the html and make it available at a location (it\u0026rsquo;ll reload and say \u0026lsquo;your page is published at\u0026hellip;') which will most likely be your-username.github.io/ar-demo/ . Grab your smartphone, fire up its browser (Firefox works well) and go to that URL. Give it permission to access your location and backwards facing camera. Carefully scan around you, slowly\u0026hellip; your model should appear! (Assuming you\u0026rsquo;re standing more or less at the location whose coordinates you added).\nConclusion This is a very basic example of something that could be done. If you explore the tutorial links I shared up above, you should be able to build more complex experiences. You could, for instance, set up relative positioning, so that assets appear in space relative to the user, wherever they may be. You could then code in all of your gravestones, and bring the graveyard to your users. You could set things up so that text or location markers appear. You could set things up so that audio plays, and the voices of the dead whisper to you\u0026hellip;\n  (For more about this video, see \u0026lsquo;Hearing the Past\u0026rsquo;.)\n","description":"Merge the Digital with the Physical","id":17,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Augmented Reality","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/11/augmented-reality/"},{"content":"Annotate this page with hypothesis while being logged into our course reading group with connections to other things you\u0026rsquo;ve read or thought about during your studies. If you spot an interesting annotation by someone else and it strikes a chord, respond generously to the annotation. Introduction I wanted you to have some experience of collecting data, and of how data models (or our expectations of what we\u0026rsquo;ll find) influence the subsequent work that we can do with the information that we collect. \u0026lsquo;Data\u0026rsquo; means things given but the goal (a goal) of this exercise is to see this information more like \u0026lsquo;capta\u0026rsquo; or things created/crafted/captured.\nArchaeology has some well established models for capturing the observations made at the trowel\u0026rsquo;s edge. In the UK for instance (where I did most of my archaeological training) the \u0026lsquo;single context\u0026rsquo; recording system as developed by the Museum of London Archaeology Service is more or less used (with variations) everywhere. (Here\u0026rsquo;s the manual).\nWe clearly can\u0026rsquo;t dig anything, in this time of Covid (and besides, it takes time to obtain a license to excavate in Ontario; looking at monuments in cemeteries however doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall under the rubric of the archaeological licensing scheme). We will be looking at archaeological data collected by others (from places like the Archaeological Data Service), but it seemed to me that you should experience just how much variability, reflexivity, and creativity is involved in trying to systematically collect information. Morgan and Eddisford argue (2019) that\n the introduction of single context recording not only had a dramatic impact on the way in which archaeology was undertaken, but also revolutionized the way social relations on site were structured. Single context recording promotes individual empowerment of diggers, allowing them to contribute to collective knowledge construction on site. Equally, it promoted a more horizontal management structure.\n In a way, the scheme that we are going to use (adapted from \u0026lsquo;Discovering England\u0026rsquo;s Burial Spaces\u0026rsquo; is similar to what Morgan and Eddisford say about single context recording: one grave at a time, you (plural) build up a broader picture of what is going on. But recognize this too: how we record data has an impact not just on the past, but the present (see also Perry 2018, 217)\nMortuary Archaeology The study of graveyards is one point where history and archaeology intersect, as both disciplines have their own bodies of literature connected with exploring how humans have dealt with their dead. I remember being taught as an undergrad the concept of seriation with reference to motifs on New England headstones (\u0026lsquo;Death\u0026rsquo;s Head, Cherub, Urn and Willow\u0026rsquo; by Deetz and Dethlefsen.)\nThe count of headstones with different motifs, when organized according to date of death, demonstrates how fashions evolve even within gravestone motifs. Which also means you can use a motif to suggest a likely date for a stone\u0026hellip;\nNow, mortuary archaeology as a branch of bioarchaeology has tended to focus more on the human remains (an overview by Bettina Arnold and Robert Jeske is available here).\nIn my own research (The Bone Trade Project) I am looking at how and why people buy human remains (which they do these days over Facebook and Instagram) using computer vision and machine learning (artificial intelligence). Many of the people whose remains are now being traded were stolen from their graves; many never even made it to the grave (people who died homeless, for instance, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be claimed by schools of anatomy for dissection).\nOntario has a history of grave robbing as well - I found this notice in the Shawville Equity:\n “Dr. Eberson, a dentist well known through-out the Ottawa Valley, was found drowned in the Rideau Lake near Portland recently, and his body was interred in the cemetary at that place. A few days since it was found that the body had been stolen by human ghouls. The coffin was kicked in and badly damaged by the graverobbers\u0026hellip; No trace of the body has yet been discovered. “ – Shawville Equity, October 9 1890\n Katie Daubs, writing in the Toronto Star, has a long piece on the history of grave robbing in Ontario.\nA project looking at graveyards and gravestones therefore sets us up to talk about digital archaeology in a number of powerful and compelling ways.\nWhen Archaeology Is In The Headlines We can\u0026rsquo;t be discussing \u0026lsquo;mortuary archaeology\u0026rsquo; without thinking of the unmarked graves at the government sanctioned, church-run residential schools; these schools were deliberately designed to forcibly assimilated Indigenous children into settler society (TRC of Canada 2015). The deaths, graveyards, and unmarked burials were never a secret; there was plenty of witness\u0026rsquo; testimony. But over the last few months, archaeological approaches using ground-penetrating radar confirmed the location of graves at Kamloops and Cowessess amongst other locations; other Nations are now searching for the graves of their children.\nDid your elementary school have a graveyard beside the play-yard? Mine didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nDr. Kisha Supernant, who directs the Institute for Prairie and Indigenous Archaeology (IPIA) at the University of Alberta, has been a leading voice on the need for ethical and trained archaeological GPR work to help communities who wish it. That\u0026rsquo;s a key point: the archaeologists do have training, tools, and techniques, but they must be invited.\nBut\u0026hellip;\n Deeply concerned about some of the stories I\u0026rsquo;m hearing about large companies who use remote sensing approaching communities about scans around IRS sites. I encourage any Indigenous community who is receiving these request to reach out for free advice from @UofA_IPIA\n. Kisha Supernant, via Twitter.\n I will copy in full the statement from IPIA following the release of the full report on the former Kamloops Indian Residential School:\n Today, Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc has released information about the preliminary ground-penetrating radar investigation undertaken by Dr. Sarah Beaulieu around the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School. Dr. Beaulieu engaged with Knowledge Keepers and Cultural Monitors to perform a preliminary, exploratory survey of an area where the experiences and testimonies of survivors indicated the presence of graves. The ground-penetrating radar work was undertaken by an experienced expert using best practices for the application of ground-penetrating radar to find possible unmarked graves and identified 200 targets of interest in the area surveyed. These targets have many characteristics of grave shafts identified in other contexts and are strongly indicative of burial locations. Further investigation of these targets is warranted, as is additional survey of other areas of the grounds associated with the Kamloops Indian Residential School. Testimonies of survivors indicate other graves are likely to be found in other areas around the Kamloops IRS.\n  Survivors and Indigenous communities have been speaking the truth of their experiences in so-called “residential schools” and related institutions for decades; it should not have taken the use of scientific techniques for the necessary attention to be paid to the truth of what happened to the survivors and to the children who never came home.\n  As AFN National Chief RoseAnne Archibald states: “We have always known.”\n  It is essential that Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc and other Indigenous nations are provided with all the resources they need as they undertake further work to find the burial locations of their children and take the next steps they deem necessary, including calls for justice and accountability. We at the Institute of Prairie and Indigenous Archaeology (IPIA) support the call of Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc to release the Student Attendance Records and to provide additional immediate and long-term resources from the federal and provincial governments. As noted in the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc media release, access to experts is critical:\n  “This work requires significant resources that includes dedicated and qualified personnel to bring truth to light and peace to family members of the missing children. This is what drove Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc to reach out to the Canadian Archaeological Association and the Institute of Indigenous and Prairie Archeology. It is also why Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc are offering a free webinar next week on remote sensing and grave detection in partnership with them.”\n  At the IPIA, we recognize the important role archaeological techniques can play in supporting communities to locate where their missing children might be buried. We are Indigenous-led and recognized as a national and international leader in using various remote sensing technologies (including ground-penetrating radar and drone mounted sensors) in burial contexts across the prairie provinces. We invite communities to reach out to us should they need advice on how best to approach the surveys around their schools in the hopes we may provide additional information and help navigating these emotional contexts. We also invite federal and provincial governments to reach out to us about how to coordinate and ensure communities have access to reliable, independent expert advice around the application of remote sensing for grave detection. Our Director, Kisha Supernant (Métis) is Chair of the Unmarked Graves Working Group of the Canadian Archaeological Association, which is developing resources for Indigenous communities about best practices around the use of remote sensing to detect unmarked graves.\n You can view the full webinar on the use of GPR to help locate unmarked burials by the Canadian Archaeological Association and the IPIA here; the slides and pdfs are also available to download. I encourage you to watch the full video\u0026hellip;\nAnd then reflect on the differences here, between graves that are unmarked, and marked; between the hidden, and the celebrated. And the role this implies for archaeology.\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC of Canada)2015aCanada’s Residential Schools: The History, Part 1 - Origins to 1939. In The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. McGill-Queens University Press, Montreal, Canada\nConclusion It seemed to me that a project where we explored local graveyards would tie together many of the strands that I wanted this class to weave together: it would also demonstrate the necessarily political work that is archaeology. The information that you collect will be used later in the course for some statistical analysis, and for the eventual final outputs that we put together. The issues that all of this will raise, the techniques that you will be exposed to, the literature: all of these will help push you towards an ethical digital archaeology. Archaeologists should be activists too, says Allison Mickel and Kyle Olson.\nWhen the day comes that you will work with other kinds of digital archaeological data, you will be able to revisit your notes and journals from this class and have a head start on whatever task it is you wish to do.\n","description":"Rationale","id":18,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Graveyard Project Rationale","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/2/rationale/"},{"content":"Introduction   The KoBoToolbox is an open source platform that allows you to design quite complex data collection forms, for use via computers or devices, both online and offline.\nIpads and similar have been used in archaeology since their invention, at places for example like Pompeii and other sites destroyed by Vesuvius. The potential applications for devices like this to speed up data acquisition and analysis practically fill entire volumes, but at the same time, leave some archaeologists worried that we\u0026rsquo;re missing something fundamental about doing archaeology, that we need a \u0026lsquo;slow\u0026rsquo; archaeology to counter them. What actually constitutes the virtues of \u0026lsquo;slowness\u0026rsquo;, and whether or not digital work is \u0026lsquo;slow\u0026rsquo; is up for debate (and of course, I have my own views on the matter\u0026hellip;)\nSuffice it to say, designing and implementing digital recording has not been an easy thing to do, and it has theoretical and ethical implications. KoBoToolbox aims to flatten that curve (and the fact that it is open source and aimed at humanitarian work adds an ethical dimension to its use).\nHere, I will provide you with the template file that I created for our class and our own recording adventure, which is an adaptation of the DEBS recording sheet created for recording English burial grounds.

The language model we\u0026rsquo;ll use - GPT-2 - is essentially a statistical model of what words are likely to be found together in a given context. If we trained a language model on my writing, the changes that the word \u0026lsquo;social\u0026rsquo; would be followed by \u0026lsquo;network\u0026rsquo; would be very high, if the rest of the text contained words like \u0026lsquo;links\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;edges\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;power\u0026rsquo;. Since the language model we\u0026rsquo;re using is trained on over 8 million websites, lord only knows what it has \u0026lsquo;learned\u0026rsquo;. Models of this kind are famous for reproducing the biases and toxic language of the internet, so they must be used with caution.\nBut, once we have such a language, we can perturb it or re-train its final outputs by giving it a specific body of information. Once we\u0026rsquo;ve done that, we can prompt the model with strings of text to collapse the possible responses. If we retrain GPT-2 with the writings of Lanciani, we\u0026rsquo;ll have a kind of simLanciani that we can interrogate.\nAt this point, we are so far off the map we\u0026rsquo;d need a map just to find the map again. What is the truth value of anything that simLanciani might say? Is it just a toy? Or could there be a route through to archaeological enchantment this way?\n  Go to this copy of Max Woolf\u0026rsquo;s notebook. That link will open the notebook in Google Colab. (You can preview a static version of the notebook here.)\n  in the cell \u0026lsquo;Downloading GPT2\u0026rsquo; we want to load the slightly larger model, the 355 mb sized one. Change the code to:\n  gpt2.download_gpt2(model_name=\u0026quot;355M\u0026quot;)  The notebook contains code for connecting to your google drive, so that you can save the trained model once it\u0026rsquo;s finished to your drive. If you do this, you can reload and return to generating text at a later time.\n  We\u0026rsquo;re going to use the wget command to copy Lanciani\u0026rsquo;s 1892 book Pagan and Christian Rome from its location at the Gutenberg Project into the notebook; this will be the text that we retrain the model on. The \u0026lsquo;wget\u0026rsquo; command is already available in the notebook; this command enables a person to download files from a server (eg, the files that, stitched together by a browser, make up a website; or the contents of a directory in an online archive). Highlight (click on) the \u0026lsquo;upload\u0026rsquo; cell explaining how to upload materials, and then hit the + code button at the top of the window. In the new empty cell, add:\n  #lanciani pagan \u0026amp; christian rome 1892 !wget http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22153/22153-0.txt  Run that cell. Then change the file name= cell to file_name = \u0026quot;22153-0.txt\u0026quot;\n  In the \u0026lsquo;Fine Tune GPT2\u0026rsquo; cell, you execute the code that fine tunes the GPT-2 language model by perturbing it with Lanciani\u0026rsquo;s voice. Change the line model_name='124M', to model_name='355M',. Don\u0026rsquo;t delete the comma!\n  Run that cell. It will train the model - which\u0026rsquo;ll take a bit of time, maybe 5 minutes - and will spit out text periodically every 200 iterations to show you its state (it runs for 1000 iterations). Note that the outputted text gets more \u0026lsquo;coherent\u0026rsquo; as the model trains.\n  Once that finishes running, you can skip ahead to \u0026lsquo;Generate Text from the Trained Model\u0026rsquo;\n  This command gpt2.generate(sess, run_name='run1') just generates a text using the defaults. (The output of training is saved as \u0026lsquo;run1\u0026rsquo;) But let\u0026rsquo;s let the machine get creative. The next command,\n  gpt2.generate(sess, length=250, temperature=0.7, prefix=\u0026quot;LORD\u0026quot;, nsamples=5, batch_size=5 ) \u0026hellip;will generate a text 250 words long, and the dial for creativity is set pretty high (\u0026lsquo;temperature\u0026rsquo;, which can scale from 0.0 to 1.0). It\u0026rsquo;ll start predicting likely text from the seed \u0026ldquo;LORD\u0026rdquo; (the demo was trained on the plays of Shakespeare, so \u0026lsquo;LORD\u0026rsquo; is a cue for a character to start speaking). Change that word to something like, \u0026ldquo;Why were the early Christians a threat to Roman power?\u0026rdquo; The notebook also shows some other settings you can tune with. Give it a try!\nYou can connect the notebook to your gdrive by running the relevant cell, and then copy your retrained model to your drive. Then, you can come back to this later, re-run the initial code block (under \u0026ldquo;to get started\u0026rdquo;), load the model (\u0026ldquo;Load a trained model checkpoint\u0026rdquo;) and generate away.\nSo what do we learn from this simLanciani?\nSome of the output when I trained my model:\n Why were the early Christians a threat to Roman power? As I stated at the outset, the reason is simple: they did not believe in the Roman Empire. After the fall of the empire, Christianity took possession of the soil on which it had built its churches, and overran the Roman countryside in pursuit of its aims. To no purpose, however, was the persecution really motivated by the Christian faith. When the empire was destroyed and the new\nfoundations established, the old superstitions of the Empire, which had\nbeen so thoroughly shaken, found no outlet whatever.\n (use ctrl+f on the original source, http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22153/22153-0.txt to search the phrases. Is it just parrotting text?)\n How much wood could a wood chuck chuck? I have been told it could not be used but once, when cutting away at a mass of thorns which was obstructing the rear entrance of a cave. In one of my earlier diaries, No. 45, I shall have a record of the unfortunate accident of my life. A woodchuck fell from one of the balconies on the fourth floor, pierced my left tibia, and wrist, and shoulder, among the many bones which littered the floor. The name of the felled bird is PHILETVS (it was aah-LEET-vah). A hortatory chapel was built around the grave, to the which it gave the name of PALMADY (please remember it, by the way).\n  What is the future of digital archaeology?\n\u0026ldquo;It is a sad state of things when one considers that, in the history of mankind, digital discoveries have yielded such a bounty that no other branch of study seems to possess a sufficient supply of material for the antiquarian synthesis.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash;H.

H. Gilbert,\n What Does It Mean? We have the voice of the late 19th century archaeologist, Rudolpho Lanciani. We could ask him/it questions related to the doing of archaeology. Or we could ask him/it questions about the social context of his work. Perhaps if you fed it a prompt about an actual archaeological site, or a historical event, you might get a new interpretation. You might think about this in the context of the work of Tiffany Chan, who used a related approach to trying to understand the work of the 19th century author Grant Allen, in her project the authorFunction. simLanciani is a kind of fun-house mirror, turned back on an important moment in the history of Roman archaeology, a distortion that perhaps reveals greater truths.\nGoing Further Try feeding (retraining) the model some modern texts; perhaps copy the text from the articles of a single modern archaeologist (open access journal articles) into a single text file, and then upload it to the notebook.\nOr if you want to get really meta, go to the source text files for this course website, copy them into a single file, paste them into gist.github.com, copy the \u0026lsquo;raw\u0026rsquo; url, and feed me into the machine\u0026hellip; what kind of course emerges?\n","description":"Language Models and Artificial Intelligence","id":24,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Raise the Dead II","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/7/raise-the-dead-ii/"},{"content":"Introduction In this tutorial, I re-purpose some instructions from my Crafting Digital History class on how to build a web map using open source code from Leaflet. The idea here is that you learn to build a map and get it online: and then you modify it to display\n the cemetery that you have worked on the location of stones  The East End Cemetery website maps a historic African American burial ground in Henrico County and the city of Richmond, Virginia, and uses Leaflet:\nEast End Cemetery Map\nWith time and practice, you would be able to build something similar. Remember, I am not expecting perfection; rather, I want you to push yourself until you get stuck.\nNb When I talk about \u0026lsquo;serving\u0026rsquo; your site in step 8, I am assuming you have python installed on your computer. If you have a mac, you probably do; if you have a PC, probably not. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to muck about with Python, you can download the free trial of prepos, which will act like a web server. Open that program, and then drag and drop the folder you are working in (always start a new project like this in a new folder) onto the prepos interface. See these instructions. By the way, subsurface georadar and other non-invasive techniques are a part of digital archaeology that can transform how we understand historical graveyards - take a look at this twitter thread.\nWebmapping with Leaflet  The following is a modified exercise from the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook Environment by Graham et al 2019; this particular section was contributed by Neha Gupta of UBC.\n First of all, a webmap is not a Geographic Information System or GIS. A webmap may be derived from a GIS, but the key difference is that a GIS allows analytical questions to be asked of, and derived from, different layers of spatial or spatialized data. Webmaps are used more for conveying the results of such analyses.\nTiled map service and Web Map Service are two forms of Web-based mapping. A WMS is an interface that enables us (the clients) to request specific maps i.e. visual representations of geographic information from a geospatial database. The WMS server is called via a Universal Resource Link (URL) on an Internet-enabled desktop GIS. A request typically consists of the geographic layer (e.g. theme) and geographic area of interest. The response to a request results in geo-registered map images that are displayed and queried within a browser. Because the map is dynamically drawn upon request, and because the server typically uses the most current information from several layers in the geospatial database, WMS maps tend to load slowly.\nTile map services such as TileMill Project, OpenStreetMap, and Stamen all use one or more vector layers that have been rasterized into an image. This rasterized image is divided into 256 x 256 adjacent pixel images or ‘tiles’. This is usually the base layer in a web map.\nEach tile is an image on the Web, which means that you can link to it. For example, the following URL points to a specific tile on the Web:\nhttps://tile.openstreetmap.org/7/63/42.png The three elements in the URL are:\n tile.openstreetmap.org, the tile server name; 7, the zoom level or z value of the tile; and finally 63/42, the x and y values in the grid where the tile lives  The z value has a range between 0 and 21, where 21 returns a tile with greatest detail (and smallest sized tile).\n\u0026lsquo;Image Tile Pyramid, https://www.azavea.com/blog/2018/08/06/generating-pyramided-tiles-from-a-geotiff-using-geotrellis/tilepyramid/’\nOnce generated, the set of tiles are stored on disk, ready to be distributed rapidly to large numbers of simultaneous requests. Tiled maps load quickly precisely because they are pre-generated. They shift attention to map aesthetics and smooth map navigation, trading in functionality such as layer order, map scale and projection. Alex Urquhart maintains a list of tile services.\nData layers are typically added on top of the base layer. Data layers can be points, lines and polygons. These data layers are saved as GeoJSON, a format designed for representing on the Web, geographic features with their non-spatial attributes.\nLeaflet is a JavaScript library developed by Vladimir Agafonkin for use with tiled maps. Launched in 2008, Leaflet has become widely used in tile web mapping because the library’s low-barrier customization and interactivity with map elements, and because of its simplified setup when compared to a WMS served map. Moreover, Leaflet’s compatibility with other Web 2.0 technologies and code-sharing platforms such as GitHub has encouraged an active community of ‘makers’.\nYou will need a proper text editor (not notepad, not, shudder, Word) to edit your files. I suggest you download, install, and use Sublime Text.\n Create a new directory on your machine and call it \u0026lsquo;web-map\u0026rsquo; Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory. We\u0026rsquo;re going to build a map now; in sublime text make a new file and save it as index.html in the web-map folder. We\u0026rsquo;ll begin by putting some important information about the building blocks we\u0026rsquo;ll use in the \u0026lsquo;header\u0026rsquo; of our file, between the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;\\head\u0026gt; tags.

Right-click, and \u0026lsquo;save as\u0026rsquo; copies of these two files into your web-map folder from here: leaflet.css and leaflet.js\nThe next bit of code defines the base map:  \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;mapid\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;width: 600px; height: 400px;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026quot;text/javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt; var myMap = L.map('mapid').setView([45.4192857, -75.6973237],13); L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {maxZoom: 19 }).addTo(myMap); We\u0026rsquo;re creating a box on the page called \u0026lsquo;mapid\u0026rsquo; and setting its width and height in pixels. Then our script creates a thing called \u0026lsquo;mymap\u0026rsquo; and defines some particulars about it: the center of the map (here, Ottawa, Ontario), the zoom level, and the basemap layer. The final bit, addTo(mymap); does the work of putting all of that information on the map (using leaflet.js).\nNow we\u0026rsquo;re going to need some data for our map. Our point data will be encoded in a format called \u0026lsquo;geojson\u0026rsquo;, which is a kind of list. If you have geographic data in a csv table, with latitude and longitude columns, you could use this tool to convert it to geojson. For now, our geojson has two points in it:  { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;FeatureCollection\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Feature\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;geometry\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Point\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;coordinates\u0026quot;: [-75.6973237, 45.4192857] }, \u0026quot;properties\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Label\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Centre of our map!\u0026quot; } }, { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Feature\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;geometry\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Point\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;coordinates\u0026quot;: [ -75.699222, 45.4275 ] }, \u0026quot;properties\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Label\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Not the centre of the map \u0026quot; } } ] } Copy that into a new file and save in your web-map folder as point-data.geojson . (When you try to build a map of your graveyard, do you see how you could add your own point data with the csv-to-geojson tool?)\nNow append the following to the index.html, which will tell leaflet where the data is and how to add it to our map:  // load a GeoJSON from external file $.getJSON(\u0026quot;point-data.geojson\u0026quot;, function(data) { // add GeoJSON layer to the map once the file is loaded var datalayer = L.geoJson(data ,{ onEachFeature: function(feature, featureLayer) { featureLayer.bindPopup(feature.properties.Label); } }).addTo(myMap); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Save!\n At the command prompt, you\u0026rsquo;ll use python to start a webserver; the webserver acts like a regular server and makes these two files understandable by your web-browser: $ python -m http.server Please see the alert at the top of the page if you don\u0026rsquo;t have python on your machine; this is where you drag your work folder into prepos.\n  The terminal will tell you now that your server is running at an address that will look something like this: (http://0.0.0.0:8000/). Copy that full address and paste it into your browser\u0026rsquo;s address bar. (It might look like http://127.0.0.1:8000 or http://localhost:8000)\n  Congratulations! You have made a webmap! Do you see how you could recenter the map on Ottawa? Add some more data? Change the base map to another style?\n(You can upload your web-map folder to Github by dragging the folder onto a repository; to make Github serve your website, you create a new branch called gh-pages. So if I loaded it into github.com/shawngraham/demo/webmap in the gh-pages branch, my map will be available at shawngraham.github.io/demo/webmap/index.html. Cool, eh?)\nAdding a new layer to our map Map Warper is a service that allows us to upload images of maps, and then tie \u0026lsquo;control points\u0026rsquo; to real-world geography such that we stretch and warp the image to overlay the physical world. It then provides us with a tile-server so that the image can be imported into our map as its own layer. Take a look at this map of Ottawa:\nThis was uploaded to Mapwarper and georectified by a former MA student at Carleton. You can see it on Mapwarper at this location. (nb Mapwarper periodically runs out of space; so look for maps that were last warper/used within the last two years ago. For maps that were last updated longer than two years ago you might need to log into Mapwarper, add some more control points to the map, and then re-georectify it to renew it, and then use for your map.)\nIf you click on the \u0026lsquo;Export\u0026rsquo; tab, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that there\u0026rsquo;s a URL for the map as tiles: http://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/29435/{z}/{x}/{y}.png.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the line we want to add to our map.\n Open your index.html file. We\u0026rsquo;re going to add another layer, just after where you first specified your basemap, which to remind you, was at:  L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {maxZoom: 19 }).addTo(myMap); Hit \u0026lsquo;enter\u0026rsquo; a few times after that final semicolon, and then paste in this:\nL.tileLayer('http://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/29435/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {maxZoom: 19} ).addTo(myMap); Save the file, and then in your browser reload the page (I\u0026rsquo;m assuming you still have the server running as per step 8 in the previous section). Boom!\nBut that map is a bit wonky, compared to our base map. Let\u0026rsquo;s find a new map from Library and Archives Canada, georectify it, and then swap it in. (When you build your own map of your graveyard, you may or may not be able to find an underlying historical map. That\u0026rsquo;s ok; if you can, great; if not, no worries.)\nGeorectifying a base map But as historians, we are often interested to show some process taking place in the past, so historical maps can be rhetorically extremely useful as base maps. But, to get such a map into a digital format that we can use, we need to georectify it.\nGeorectifying is the process of taking an image (whether it is of a historical map, chart, airphoto, or whatever) and manipulating its geometry so that it matches a geographic projection. Think of it like this: you take your handdrawn map, and use pushpins to pin down known locations on your map to a globe. As you pin, your image stretches and warps. Traditionally, this has not been an easy thing to do, if you are new to GIS. In recent years, the curve has flattened significantly. In this exercise, we\u0026rsquo;ll grab an image, upload it to the Map Warper website, and then export it as a tileset which can be used in other mapping programs.\nAt Library and Archives Canada I found an \u0026ldquo;Insurance Plan of Ottawa, June 1878\u0026rdquo; MIKAN 3824226. (nb last time I checked, both of those links were borked at LAC\u0026rsquo;s end; July 23 2021)\nThis one in particular shows Parliament Hill. I will save this one to my machine and georectify it. You grab one that interests you!\n  Go to Map Warper and sign up for an account. Then login.\n  Go to the upload screen:\n  Fill in as much of the metadata as you can - it\u0026rsquo;s important to credit the material correctly! Then select your map from your computer, and upload it.\n  On the next page, click \u0026lsquo;Rectify\u0026rsquo;.\n  Pan and zoom both maps until you\u0026rsquo;re sure you\u0026rsquo;re looking at the same area in both. Double click in a map, select the location icon, and click on a point (location) you are sure you can match in the other window.\n  Click on the other map window, select the location icon, and then click on the same point.\n  Note the \u0026lsquo;Add control point\u0026rsquo; button below and between both maps will light up. Click on this to confirm that this is a control point you want. Do this at least three times; the more times you can do it, the better the map warp.\n  Having selected your control points, click on \u0026lsquo;Warp image\u0026rsquo;.\n  You can now click on the \u0026lsquo;Export\u0026rsquo; panel, and get the URL for your georectified image in a few different formats. Copy the tiles based URL and put that URL into your index.html file as you did in the previous section.\n  Adding a layer control button You can see that with leaflet it is pretty easy to add more layers and more data to your map. But soon things get a little bit unwieldy. We\u0026rsquo;re going to re-organize our map so that we can turn layers on and off.\nThe end result will look like this:\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create some variables to hold our different layers and maps. Make a copy of your index.html file and call it index2.html. Open index2.html in Sublime Text and work on that file.\n Delete the code from the var myMap = line to the // load a GeoJSON from external file. Your code should look like this now:  \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;mapid\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;width: 600px; height: 400px;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; // load a GeoJSON from external file We are going to create four variables that contain the different layers we want to show. Two are going to be base maps from Stamen (the \u0026lsquo;toner\u0026rsquo; map and the \u0026lsquo;watercolor\u0026rsquo; map), and two are going to be georectified maps we found on MapWarper showing downtown Ottawa. Insert after the \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag:\nvar toner = L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'), watercolor = L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/watercolor/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'), historical1897 = L.tileLayer('https://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/29435/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'), lumberdistrict = L.tileLayer('https://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/27671/{z}/{x}/{y}.png') The L.tileLayer tells leaflet the sources for our layers.\nNow we\u0026rsquo;re going to create two more variables to group our layers into base maps and overlay maps:\nvar baseMaps = { \u0026quot;Toner\u0026quot;: toner, \u0026quot;Watercolor\u0026quot;: watercolor }; var overlayMaps = { \u0026quot;1897\u0026quot;: historical1897, \u0026quot;Lumber District\u0026quot;: lumberdistrict } Next, we create a variable called myMap to tell Leaflet the centre of our map, the zoom layer, and the default base map; we pass this information to the html container \u0026lsquo;mapid\u0026rsquo; so that our creation can be displayed:\nvar myMap = L.map('mapid', { center: [45.4192857, -75.6973237], zoom: 13, layers:[toner] }); and finally, we add a control box so that we can switch the different layers on and off, and that our layers are grouped appropriately:\nL.control.layers(baseMaps, overlayMaps).addTo(myMap); Save that as index2.html, and with your server still running, you can view it in your browser at http://localhost:8000/index2.html. (NB: the part after the colon might be different on your machine - this number is the \u0026lsquo;port\u0026rsquo; and the precise port number will have printed out in your terminal when you first ran the python -m http.server command.)\nFor more on layers with leaflet, see Layer Groups and Layers Control.\nThe Graveyard Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve seen how to build a map and serve it online, let\u0026rsquo;s modify it to show the graveyard you worked on.\n You\u0026rsquo;ll want the map to be centred on the graveyard you worked on, so you need to figure out the coordinates for it. These will go in the code for the variable myMap, and are in decimal degrees. Coordinates for your stones go in the geojson file. Easiest way to do this might be to make a csv table like so, in a text editor like Sublime Text:  latitude,longitude,geometry,Label 45.4192857,-75.6973237,Point,Centre of our map! 45.4275,-75.699222,Point,Not the centre of the map and then use this tool to convert it to geojson.\n You can try to find a historical map for an underlay, but only if you\u0026rsquo;re feeling keen.

I want you to explore it here. Each of the bubbles is a \u0026lsquo;topic\u0026rsquo;; if you click on \u0026lsquo;years\u0026rsquo; you\u0026rsquo;ll see a \u0026lsquo;stream graph\u0026rsquo;, or the proportion each topic accounts for that year\u0026rsquo;s total archaeological writing output (in English speaking journals). Notice the inflection points? What was going on in the world at those points? (Remember there\u0026rsquo;s a lag between work being done, and work being published). What other patterns do you notice? Are there topics that perhaps relate to the themes of this course? In what journals? By what authors? A bit of clarification: We\u0026rsquo;re used to \u0026lsquo;close reading\u0026rsquo; in history, parsing individual words and sentences to understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on, reading between the lines and so on. By contrast, a topic model takes a large scale, macroscopic view: what patterns are visible when we soar up to 20 000 feet, as it were: what are large scale patterns in archaeology? So this is a way of getting a sense of archaeology\u0026rsquo;s historiographic evolution. By \u0026lsquo;explore\u0026rsquo; then, I want you to use the different facets of the visualization tool to spot patterns, and then dive back down to the \u0026lsquo;micro\u0026rsquo; view presented by our readings/course materials. Cycle between close and distant; identify ideas at the micro, then see what correlates at the macro (search for words, ideas, etc, in the tool) World Archaeology tries to be a much more \u0026hellip;global\u0026hellip; journal. It\u0026rsquo;s not included in the 20 000 topic model. Here\u0026rsquo;s another topic model just for this particular journal. Explore, and contrast this with the previous. You can continue to try the exercises from last week as well.  A quick video introducing the idea of a topic model:\n  With tech work, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come together in about 30 minutes, it won\u0026rsquo;t come in an hour. So take a break.

(You can read the preprint here).\nOf course, this depends on archaeologists publishing both the code and the underlying data for their work, something that is unfortunately still comparatively rare. When the results of archaeological research can\u0026rsquo;t be replicated or examined, there is an argument to be made that the research is unethical.\nIn this exercise, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at one student\u0026rsquo;s attempt at replicating research done by Marwick. We\u0026rsquo;re going to replicate the replication.\nThe student, Hope Loiselle, chose to replicate one aspect of the analysis in this article. Marwick\u0026rsquo;s data is online at the data sharing site Figshare.\nGet set up.  Launch the binder containing R Studio. This will open up the Jupyter file explorer for our binder.

At the console, use the git command to clone Marwick\u0026rsquo;s repository: $ git clone https://github.com/benmarwick/teaching-replication-in-archaeology.git. You do not type the $; that is a convention to indicate that the code should be entered at the console.

Using the file explorer in R Studio, navigate to analysis/supplementary-materials/submitted-assigments/Hope-Loiselle/. Then use the cogwheel icon in the files pane (bottom right panel of RStudio, normally) to set that as your working directory.  Replicate Create a new R Script, and paste in the modified version of Hope Loiselle\u0026rsquo;s code. Annotate it with what you think she\u0026rsquo;s trying to do.

Using # to mark off your comments from your code, make your observations in this script. Save the script, and put a copy of it in your repo.  Knit Then, open her replication report, which is this file: Replication_Report_Lithics.Rmd. This is a special kind of markdown file that mixes code that runs with the analysis around it. When that file is open, and you have it selected (ie, you can edit it in your script window), a new button appears called \u0026lsquo;knit\u0026rsquo;. If you hit that button, R Studio will run the code and push the results and text through a series of filters to transform it into a Word document.

If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation. Introduction This week, I am asking you to go out into your community and find a historic graveyard to work on. There was a graveyard in the middle of a field not far from the childhood home of a friend of mine. Who owned it? Who was responsible for it? Whose field was it in? Today, that field has been built over, with a couple of big box stores and a Tim Horton\u0026rsquo;s. The graveyard is still there, around back behind some dumpsters. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly overgrown, but periodically somebody hacks back some of the brush and picks up the garbage. Near where I live now, there is a historic graveyard in a corner of a city park, and the city keeps it clean and mows the lawn.\nBoth of these graveyards should be studied, but one of these is a safer place to work than the other.\nPersonal Safety \u0026gt; Course Work The first thing to keep in mind is that your personal safety is more important than course work. I have an alternative project for cases where it is either not safe or not feasible for you to go out to a historic (or currently active) graveyard. Just follow the instructions for the alternative project Things to consider This means that you will have to consider a number of elements before you go out:\n Can I actually get to the graveyard? Is it possible to work out who is responsible for the graveyard? If I see a graveyard called \u0026lsquo;Anytown United Cemetery\u0026rsquo; then I would look for the Anytown United Church and contact its office. Similarly for the Anytown Roman Catholic or the Anytown Free Methodist and so on. Small historic graveyards are often family cemeteries, and might be in a field or parcel of land belonging to the family. Or it might belong to someone else. You can explore historical land registry books (the link is for the City of Ottawa, but you can switch that) to find out the older history of the site. Obtain permission to survey the graveyard; speak to an individual rather than writing (you\u0026rsquo;ll get a quicker response). Use this form of words:   I would like to ask for permission to do a study of the grave monuments in [name of cemetery], as part of my coursework. This would involve photographing and measuring the stones. I will not be interfering with the stones or any of the planting or landscape. I believe it should not take me more than three or four days. The information I collect will be used in my class and ideally will be online if you agree. I can put you in contact with my Professor, Dr. Shawn Graham, if you have any questions about that aspect of the work.\n If you can\u0026rsquo;t find the owner (or if permission isn\u0026rsquo;t implied, as in the case of the graveyard in the public park mentioned above), or they decline your request, then do not survey that particular graveyard.\nConducting the Survey: Personal Safety  Do not go alone; take a companion Let people know where you are going, and when, and when you believe you will return Take a cellphone with you Bring water Wear sunscreen Wear appropriate clothing for a graveyard. Appropriate means \u0026lsquo;suitable to the task\u0026rsquo;; if the graveyard is overgrown, wear long pants and socks (ticks are a very real issue in Ontario). Similarly, if the graveyard is still active, there may well be mourners present and so be respectful. You represent the University. Conduct yourself accordingly. Do not sit on gravestones, put your lunch on a stone, or otherwise interfere with a grave.  Conducting the Survey Itself For instructions on how to conduct the survey itself, please begin by sketching the plan of the graveyard, and then how to record the graves\nSafety Online in the Case of Virtual Sites If you do the alternative project and the site you select features opportunities for online interactions, please take care; if it\u0026rsquo;s possible, create a character or use an account unrelated to your other online activities. Don\u0026rsquo;t engage with other players: ideally you want to be an observer in the space, rather than an active participant.\n","description":"instructions","id":28,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Working Safely","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/2/safework/"},{"content":"This exercise depends on a complicated series of dependencies that do not play nice with the online RStudio binder I set up for you. Try installing R and RStudio on your own machine if you want to give this a try. Otherwise, I would suggest giving this a pass. You could try rstudio cloud which you can sign up for a free account with using your github credentials; or try to install the free RStudio desktop (which also means installing R first). Again, because of the dependencies issue, I am ok with you just reading through these instructions and reflecting on what it takes to make archaeology replicable\u0026hellip;\nIntroduction Archaeology - more than most disciplines - has problems with reproducibility, in the sense that many of our methods are inherently destructive. To excavate is to destroy. But it is also an act of creation, as I hope you\u0026rsquo;ve started to realize - the data that we record, the metadata that describes the nature of that data, the paradata that describes the contexts of our work and how that affects what it is we are able to see and record.\nA few years ago, I was a co-signer on a manifesto for open science in archaeology, led by Ben Marwick. Consider this figure from that article:\nMost of what we - as academics, as students - write is \u0026lsquo;advertising\u0026rsquo; for the research. How can we reproduce someone\u0026rsquo;s methods on a new body of material, if we can\u0026rsquo;t see the original code or data transformations? (And imagine trying to write a guide to data work in excel - \u0026lsquo;click on this thing, then that thing, oh your version of excel is different, ok, where is it\u0026rsquo;.) How can we replicate someone\u0026rsquo;s results to see if they got it right, if we can\u0026rsquo;t access the untransformed data?\nScholars such as Marwick have invested considerable scholarly effort in developing infrastructure and templates to address these shortcomings.\nRrtools Marwick created a special package for R called \u0026lsquo;rrtools\u0026rsquo; to make it easier for scholars and students to create reproducible packages for their research. When a user runs it, it creates all of the necessary folders and templates - analsysis, data, transformed data, and an rmarkdown file that can be a template for a journal article, mixing the analytical code and results right in with the text. (In advanced usage, it even copies the state of the machine and all installed packages so that a person can replicate everything about the analysis). The result can be copied or zipped up and deposited in a digital archive to support a journal or assignment. Some journals in fact require that data and code be made available as a condition of publishing; rrtools systematizes this.\nR Markdown\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve been using markdown in your own repositories to add simple semantics to your text files - ## for a second level header and so on. R markdown is a version of markdown that lets you mix in R code that R will run as it turns your text file into a word document. Code gets set off like this:\nNote the narrative written around the actual code.\nWhen you tell R Studio that a file is in r markdown (it understands the file extension .rmd as rmarkdown), a new button appears labelled knit. If you click on that, R Studio will run your document through a template to turn it into (in this case a Word doc) and will also run all of the code and print the results into the document. If there are errors in the code, it will stop, and you have to fix them, then try again.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll do You will launch this binder (right-click, launch in new tab): http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/o-date/r-conda/master. This exercise depends on a complicated series of dependencies that do not play nice with the online RStudio binder I set up for you. Try installing R and RStudio on your own machine if you want to give this a try.\nThat will take you to the virtual computer running jupyter and R. Under the \u0026lsquo;New\u0026rsquo; button at right, select \u0026lsquo;R Studio\u0026rsquo;. Start a new script.\nCopy this R script to your environment (right-click, save-as, open it in your text editor, copy it to a new script window in RStudio running in your browser) and work through it; it will install rrtools for you, and coach you through making your own research compendium. The data that you will use will be our aggregated graveyard survey data; there\u0026rsquo;s code in that file to copy the data to your compendium. In your rmarkdown file, I want you to do at least one exploratory statistic and one visualization. More of course would be awesome, but let\u0026rsquo;s aim for one, for now.\nnb when you run the line devtools:install_github(\u0026quot;benmarwick/rrtools\u0026quot;) R Studio, in the console, might tell you that there are things to update, and what would you like to do?\nMake sure to save your work, and to zip it up and download it from the binder. I cannot stress this enough. If you walk away from your computer and leave it idle for around ten minutes you will lose your work. Save early, save often, zip, and download.\nThen, put the zip file and the resulting Word doc in your own github repo for this week.\nReady? Go!\n","description":"Your own reproducible research","id":29,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"A Research Compendium of One's Own","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/10/start-compendium/"},{"content":"Before you head out to the graveyard that you intend to record, I want you to make a sketchmap to bring with you.\nWhile the digital recording system that we are using can read the geolocation of your device when you are standing at a stone, the accuracy of that location might not be enough for us to understand any spatial patterns that might exist. While testing the system in a local graveyard, I found that stones a few feet apart would show up on the map (using my cellphone\u0026rsquo;s geolocation) hundreds of feet apart. It\u0026rsquo;s not very good resolution.\nNormally, in archaeology, extremely careful surveying is done so that everything that is recorded or recovered has a precise location in three dimensional space, keyed in to larger systems of spatial organization. For obvious reasons, we can\u0026rsquo;t do that.\nInstead, I want you to begin by making a sketch map of the graveyard. You might want to try using Google Earth Pro to see if you can find your graveyard; if you can, print out a screenshot and use that as the basis for your sketchmap and developing your recording scheme. It might be that where you live there is sufficient demand for high-resolution imagery that you can even make out individual stones. Where I live, that\u0026rsquo;s not the case.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a screenshot from Google Maps of a cemetery in a park in the Riverside South part of Ottawa:\nI have a simple paint program on my computer, and I used it to create this:\nI could print that out on a single sheet of paper, and use that to indicate the various graves, which I would then number. - MCOO for the cemetery (Moodie Cemetery Ottawa Ontario), and mcoo-01, mcoo-02 for the graves. I could add more details as I found them - stones that aren\u0026rsquo;t visible in the satellite image, for instance.\nThe cemetery is surrounded by an ornamental fence. I could measure that, and indicate the lengths on this map. I could measure in from two sides to each stone, so that I know the distance and positioning of each stone.\nIf you number the stones on your sketch, then you can be sure you don\u0026rsquo;t miss any, and should someone else make use of your data, they will know which stones you are referring to.\nIf satellite imagery isn\u0026rsquo;t available, you could go to the graveyard, and simply sketch the terrain - indicate major features of the landscape, falls in the land, landmarks unlikely to change. Take measurements so that the position of the stones can be unambiguous.\nThe sketchmap is a tool to use when you\u0026rsquo;re out at the graveyard. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be pretty. Feel free to take a quick snap of your sketchmap and share it in Discord. (Also, make sure to put it in your repo for this week too.)\n(Later, you\u0026rsquo;ll try to make a digital map from your sketchmap. You might be able to work out coordinates for your stones between what your phone\u0026rsquo;s geolocation says, and what you can deduce from looking at Google Earth or Google Maps).\n","description":"Sketchmaps Do Hard Work","id":30,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Making a Sketch Map of Your Site","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/2/sketchmap/"},{"content":"Consolidation Pause II Goals for this week  Use this time to catch up on anything you didn\u0026rsquo;t read, to try some of the exercises over again, and to consolidate what you\u0026rsquo;ve achieved so far.

There’s something horrible about having to stare off-centre at your camera so that it appears like you’re looking out of your little window box at everyone else; but everyone else is staring off camera too, and frankly the whole thing feels like horrible small talk at an awkward faculty social event.\nSo we’re not going to be doing that.\nInstead, I would like you to listen to these short podcast episodes, wherever it is comfortable for you to do that. These are not lectures, by the way. A good lecturer takes their cues from audience reaction and interest. Obviously, I can’t do that.\nNo, these podcasts will follow the same basic structure – I’ll remind you of what you ought to be doing, suggest things to keep in mind, and maybe riff a bit on some of the key ideas for the week, how they link to previous weeks, and how they foreshadow the upcoming work. I have also persuaded a number of digital archaeologists to join me throughout the course to offer up their thoughts on what it means to do digital archaeology.\nPart II This week is the ‘getting started’ week, so I need to take a bit more time to lay some groundwork. As I wrote on the course website:\nI’ve taught online for a variety of institutions, using a variety of formats and approaches. I like teaching asnchronously because I believe it is a kinder approach to complex topics, especially when there is a second layer of difficulty - basic digital literacy, in this case - which intersects with the content, my learning goals for you, your own personal situations - in ways I cannot always anticipate or know.\nSince I cannot know these things, I do not believe that I should bludgeon you with content; I do not think that ‘rigour’ is demonstrated by forcing you to join me at set times; I do not believe that face-to-face work is somehow more ‘scholarly’ than other kinds of work. Right now, with the world the way it is, I want to build a structure that opens possibility space for you to engage with this topic, and with ‘digital archaeology’ when you encounter it beyond this course, in ways that will push you forward as a scholar and citizen.\nFor this to work well, it requires you to be on the same page as me. There is a lot of flexibility built into this course, but it does require you to try to push yourself out of your comfort zone. The key thing is always to tie what you’re doing with what you’re reading and what you’re thinking. That ‘second layer of difficulty’ will come with practice. But how it intersects with everything else: that’s where the learning happens.\nYou will get to do some self-directed digital field work – I want you, if you are able, to go out to a local historic graveyard and do some data recording (there is an alternative assignment if that isn’t feasible for you). As a class, we will end up generating quite a lot of data that we will then be able to explore from various viewpoints and other digital archaeological approaches.\nIt might seem a bit macabre or ‘off’ somehow to build some of our work around the ways the dead are memorialized in Canadian graveyards, in this time of pandemic. I wrestled with this. But I settled on doing this for a variety of reasons. One, the simple reason that getting you outside and doing one variety of archaeological work and thinking through how tech intersects with field work and the realities of space is a valuable exercise; two it gives us data that we can work on later as the weather grows colder; and more importantly - three - we don’t often talk about death in modern Western culture. Memorialization and its practices can reveal much about past human groups, but in the gaps with our present day, can teach us much about ourselves.\n\u0026hellip;and that is why this course is the way it is. No doubt, things will break, and some things will work better/be more effective than others. We will roll with it.\nNow – go get a drink, because I want to talk to you about failure and technology and what ‘rolling with it’ can mean. In fact, I’m going to tell you about some of the ways I’ve really screwed up.\nPart III  The next 15 or so minutes is drawn from Failing Gloriously\n The End This week, it’s all about getting yourself set up with what amounts to your own ‘digital archaeology’ laboratory. On the course website, each week has a page of instructions, and then supporting tutorials or walk throughs to help you do the tasks I want you to complete. In week 1, you will set up a Github account and make your first private repository. Don’t forget to add me as a collaborator on your account. Each week you’ll make a new repository for that week’s work. You will set up a Hypothesis account; hypothesis enables an overlay on anything you read on the way, where you can make annotations of the text. We have a private group for this; make sure you join it and that every time you make an annotation, you make it in our group. Otherwise, it’ll be visible to the world. Finally, make sure to join our Discord server. I will do my office hours there. More importantly, it’s a social space where everyone else is going through the same thing. When things don’t work, or you’re confused, ask for help! DIGITAL ARCHAEOLOGY IS A TEAM SPORT. You do not get extra points for being a heroic lone scholar. But you might get them if you’re collaborative, helpful, and willing to ask for help when you need it.\nEach week, I want you to record two documents – a ‘notes’ document that is like a lab notebook. Into this goes the commands that you typed, error messages that you received, all those memos-to-self that help you remember how to do the digital tasks. The other document is a ‘journal’, where you do the joined-up thinking, explicitly tying what you did – successes and hiccups both – to the stuff you read. Each week you will log the location of these in a google form so that I can take a look and help you out. At the end of each module, you’ll use these to produce a consolidation document that will get submitted for grades.\nWell, that’s about enough out of me for now. Read the Syllabus pages carefully, Read the Week 1 materials carefully, and when things are unclear, ask me or your peers for clarification.\nI can’t emphasize it enough: DIGITAL ARCHAEOLOGY is a TEAM SPORT. I want you to succeed; I’m not trying to catch you out. Life’s too short for that kind of crap.\n","description":"In this episode, I introduce some of the important themes for this class, bring you up to speed on what needs to be done this week, and try to reassure you that when things break, all is not lost: digital work at its best understands that 'failures' happen. Since digital archaeology is a team sport, we can draw on each other to understand the kind of failures we're dealing with, and use that process of reflection to move forward. This episode is a bit longer than what will be the usual in this class. Some of the material comes from the 'failing gloriously' chapter of my book.","id":32,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"Module 1 Episode 1","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/transcripts/episode-1/"},{"content":"Transcript of this week\u0026rsquo;s podcast episode.\nPart I This week you\u0026rsquo;re going out into the field. But which field? When I was a kid, there was a graveyard on the other side of the dirt road from our farm. It had about six or seven headstones, and an old wrought-iron fence that surrounded the little plot. One stone was flat on the ground, at the centre of the graveyard. Almost like a lid. In fact, now that I think about it, it was probably a family vault, with soil backfilled around it. That would explain why this little burial ground was so much higher than the surrounding fields. Even when we bury our dead, we change the environment around us.\nThat graveyard fascinated me as a kid. Who were these people? Where did they come from? Where did they live? Was my house their house? This was probably where my own journey into archaeology began, trying to understand how this little graveyard related to my house, my farm, and the nearby river. I didn\u0026rsquo;t go there very often though; I was just a kid, and the place terrified me.\nMortuary archaeology, as I conceive of it, is about the study of burial customs and human remains. This week, we begin our graveyard project. There are a lot of ethical issues involved. Some of them are obvious, involving things like obtaining permission to go wandering over what is quite often private property. Some are more subtle, like, what obligations do we owe to the people we are studying, and to their descendents? Some issues only become apparent once we start obtaining data en masse, which is to say, the ethical issue emerges as we draw conclusions based on entire populations.\nSo: our fieldwork begins this field. Which field? Ideally, there is a graveyard not too far from where you are, that is accessible, and for which you can reasonably obtain permission to study. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a smaller town, you might just be able to call up the office for the church or other institution responsible for the graveyard. For rural family plots like the one across the road from my childhood home, it could be more difficult. Some graveyards are run by modern corporations, and likely won\u0026rsquo;t be bothered in the least if you quietly, and respectfully, begin to record information from the stones. Figuring this out will be your first challenge.\nRecording the information will be your second challenge. The digital recording forms will work offline; you\u0026rsquo;ll need to bring a smartphone or laptop with you with the forms pre-loaded and bookmarked. You could just use our recording scheme with a paper notebook, as well. \u0026lsquo;Digital archaeology\u0026rsquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t always mean a device at every turn. The scheme we\u0026rsquo;ll use was developed in Britain. You might find that it has assumptions about the study populations that are not always warranted; pay attention to when things don\u0026rsquo;t fit!\nMy archaeological background is in Roman materials from central Italy. It was in petrology, and mineralogy, and epigraphy, and social networks. Canadian burials were not my area. As you go out this week, I will be recording as well. All of our data gets collated into a central database, and the results will be made available to you.\nGraveyards are liminal spaces, and given the ways our cities have grown, are now sometimes in very out of the way or otherwise dodgy places. When you go out, ideally have someone from your social bubble go with you. Always tell people where you are going, and when you\u0026rsquo;ll be back. Have a phone with you.\nPart II This week, we\u0026rsquo;re joined by Robyn Lacy.\nHello, my name is Robin Lacey, and I am a historic archaeologist currently working in crm, which is cultural resource management in Ontario. I am currently working on publishing my first book, which is based on my master\u0026rsquo;s research, with some other things thrown in there. I signed a contract to write my second book which I\u0026rsquo;m really excited about, and I am also preparing to start my phd in historical archaeology, focusing on mortuary studies, because most of my research focuses on burials.\nI got started in mortuary archaeology in my undergrad. I went into my undergrad in archaeology being interested in maritime archaeology, and I was really interested in mesoamerican studies so I went to the university of calgary because their department is known for that but I decided that I wanted to do a field school in a specific place rather than on a specific topic and I went to Ireland and the Isle of Man with the University of Liverpool. And the first thing that we did at that field school was spent two weeks in County Monaghan in the northeast of the Republic of Ireland recording cemeteries and basically after those two weeks I completely shifted everything I wanted to do with my research. This was after the first year of my undergrad but I get pretty set on ideas and I\u0026rsquo;m still here starting my PhD looking at burial practices and landscapes of - deathscapes I guess you could call them? I think a challenge facing Mortuary archaeology at the moment is focussing on this idea of the \u0026lsquo;good death\u0026rsquo; particularly of white settlers. When we talk about 17th century colonial settlement which is where a lot of my research focuses, what you get is a whitewashed idea of what the 17th century colonies were like but of course they weren\u0026rsquo;t all white people that were coming here - there were black people there were other people of colour, there were indigenous people that were living in and around these communites as well and their death practices and their attitudes towards mortality and their understanding of death within their families and within their communities should not be whitewashed and that\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m interested in looking at with my PhD research is just like not saying that they weren\u0026rsquo;t all white we assume and that\u0026rsquo;s wrong and that\u0026rsquo;s definitely a problem you got whenreading documents about that sort of thing. so I\u0026rsquo;m really interested in looking at all of the cultural practices that were being put into play as early as the 17th century for Colonial settlements.\nSomething that really bothers me about working in mortuary archaeology and public Archaeology is the ideas that people get - because there\u0026rsquo;s not enough information about what we do available to the public. Obviously that skews what people know about archaeology overall but particularly for mortuary archaeology - if you start talking to anyone about graveyards or cemeteries, they tell you about their friend who restore gravestones and they tell you about their own attempts to restore gravestones particularly with volunteer organizations and that is wonderful and volunteers are the people doing most of the restoration and cleaning of these historic sites, but it becomes a problem when the information isn\u0026rsquo;t there that they can update their conservation and restoration techniques for gravestones and then we end up dealing with an awful lot of poor restoration that can\u0026rsquo;t be rectified in the future and actually does more damage to the grave stones themselves. Personally my vendetta is against concrete - feel free to ask memore about that! - but I am trying to make as much conservation information possible for people to get their hands on regardless of whether or not they are professional conservators or in academia because gravestones are there for everyone and everyone, and historic gravestones are kept by volunteer groups and they\u0026rsquo;re kept by the public and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.\nI love the question about failures in archaeology and it\u0026rsquo;s definitely something that we as early career researchers and graduate students should understand that it happens and understand other people\u0026rsquo;s stories so that when our own research goes a little weird sometimes we can understand why and how to grow from that. My own masters research was partially based around looking for the 17th century burial grounds at the colony of Avalon at Ferryland in Newfoundland and I spent 10 weeks over the course of my Master\u0026rsquo;s doing very calculated excavations and ground-penetrating radar survey. At the end of the 10 weeks we had not located any of the burials or everyone would have heard about it by now but I still got my Master\u0026rsquo;s degree so it all work out fine in the end.\nI think what makes me really happy and hopeful about archaeology is all of the enthusiasm that people have in the field even when working in CRM when we\u0026rsquo;re in fairly difficult working conditions, when it is incredibly hot in Ontario, we\u0026rsquo;re still there to do a job and we\u0026rsquo;re there to do what we can to protect the heritage of an area and the archaeology of an area before development comes through and potentially destroys something that would be irreplaceable to the archaeological record so yeah that\u0026rsquo;s what I really like and I also really enjoy teaching the public about the research that I\u0026rsquo;ve got going on, that my colleagues and friends have going on and just my own enthusiasm I hope spreads a little bit of excitement and what every other archaeologist I know as well would probably tell you similar things. ","description":"In this episode, I offer some advice on what to look for in the materials this week, as well as things to think about as you get started with the Graveyard Project.

It took me about 15 minutes to walk there, crossing roads with heavy traffic. It\u0026rsquo;s in the corner of a city park, underneath some trees. The ground outside the little graveyard\u0026rsquo;s precinct is lumpy and uneven, and, as I peer into the underbrush, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty certain that I\u0026rsquo;m seeing the foundation pit of a small structure. As I recorded the graves into our digital recording form, I got frustrated. The shape and designs of the stones almost matches the example types from the \u0026lsquo;Discovering England\u0026rsquo;s Burial Spaces\u0026rsquo;, but not quite. And so I have to make some decisions. Is it more like this type or that type? I\u0026rsquo;m aware that as I make my decisions, I am creating a record, and that the record is not the thing itself\u0026hellip; but as it becomes a data point, it takes on a different kind of materiality altogether.\nThe work of recording these stones is neither fast nor efficient. I make mistakes. I must\u0026rsquo;ve sat on the grass staring at the stone and flipping through my print out of the different types for 30 minutes, just for the one stone. In fact, when you think about it, this act of recording the stone is a bit like close reading. It forces me to pay attention to the material of the stone, the shape of its decorations, the motifs used, the verses inscribed, the names and relationships of the dead. One of the stones is for a small child, who passed away at 4 years of age. No details are given, but I think of my own children; I look at another stone and note the same date-of-death and realize that here is the mother, and I wonder at what calamity took them both.\nIt is in fact quite an emotional moment, I have no hesitation to share that. This week, you\u0026rsquo;re continuing to record your stones. It does take a lot of time, but to do it well forces you to think about this interplay between the act of recording and the close reading of the material. Think about what is lost, and what is gained, by this act of recording. I wonder to myself, how do I record the affective aspect of doing this work? Surely that\u0026rsquo;s part of what a memorial to the departed is meant to achieve? What does our recording system miss?\nThis week, in addition to finishing your work in the graveyards, I want you to try to create 3d models of some of the stones. This too is a kind of close contemplation of a stone, because it takes care and effort to capture photos that can be stitched together into a model. When the light falls across the stones at an oblique angle, it can sometimes be easier to read the inscriptions; in a 3d model, when you digitally \u0026lsquo;remove\u0026rsquo; the surface texture you can sometimes see the inscriptions in the model surface. For me, these models have \u0026lsquo;aura\u0026rsquo; because they are imbued with the work, care, and attention that went into reading and recording the stones in the first place. Years ago, Walter Benjamin in a piece called \u0026lsquo;The work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction\u0026rsquo; argued that a reproduction has no aura, no authenticity, that \u0026lsquo;aura\u0026rsquo; was connected with the uniqueness of a thing; a reproduction has no authority to speak about the thing reproduced. I have my doubts.\nThis week, you continue to put materials into a database, and you create digital representations of these materials. Think about what is created by these acts of digitization. Think about the emotional connection you may have with the material, think about how you\u0026rsquo;ve come to know this material. This is the day-to-day work of digital archaeology.\nPart II This week, we\u0026rsquo;re joined by Bill Caraher.\nWhat follows is Bill\u0026rsquo;s own transcription, first posted on his blog. Click through to read that version if you want to see what else Bill linked to. T\nMy name is Bill Caraher and I’m currently working on a few project including the preliminary report of 5 or 6 years of field work in the Western Argolid with the Western Argolid Regional Project (WARP), the final publication of some excavations in eastern Cyprus concluded in 2012 with the Pyla-Koutsopetria Archaeological Project (PKAP), and a long-term publication project at Polis Chrysochous in western Cyprus as part of the Princeton Cyprus Expedition. These projects are all very data centered in that our analysis draws directly from our databases and GIS and have data publication as part of their priorities.\nI’m also writing a small book on the archaeology of the contemporary American experience and some very local CRM projects with my wife who is the local Historic Preservation Coordinator.\nI am the publisher and director at The Digital Press at the University of North Dakota and the editor of the literary journal North Dakota Quarterly.\nHow did you get started in digital archaeology?  I came to archaeology quite late in my graduate school career. In fact, I’ve never even taken an archaeology course at any level and didn’t do my first fieldwork until after my MA. In an old school way, pre-professional way, I am completely “field trained.”\nAs a result, when I started working around archaeologists on Tim Gregory’s various projects in the Corinthia, I was drawn to work for which I had some degree of competence (i.e. not necessarily fieldwork!). Because my parents were computer people (my father has patents on digital “notebooks” for research) and my mother taught programing at the college level and worked in bio-informatics, I can’t remember not having a computer in the house. I don’t have any formal training or expertise for computer work or programing — for example, I’m not much of coder and I never really call myself a “digital archaeologists” — but I don’t fear computers and generally feel comfortable following directions and using most off-the-shelf computer programs for their intended purposes. More than that, as much as I love field work, I don’t really have any discernible expertise as an archaeologist. In other words, by putting me in front of a computer and tasking me to keep track of stuff, a project isn’t losing a key member of their field team or depriving the project of hard earned field expertise.\nAs a result, I took pretty quickly to working with Microsoft Access, ESRI ArcGIS, and various more specialized applications used for data capture and processing (various pieces of Trimble software, Agisoft Metashape, et c.). I also have a bit of knack for digital “workflow management,” and while I’m not a detailed person, my long experience with computers has made it relatively easy to think systematically.\nAs a result, when I went on my first archaeological projects (the Ohio State University excavations at Isthmia and the Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey (EKAS)), I gravitated to computer work because I thought that maybe I could be helpful there. Fortunately, the folks doing computer work for EKAS — Richard Rothaus and his cadre of GIS-trained graduate students — were super welcoming and walked me through various programs with unbelievable patience and generosity.\nAs EKAS field work wound down, I become more and more interested in how the data worked and how I could use GIS and databases to support field work (and how these programs shaped what we could and could not document in the field). As I did some independent fieldwork, I leaned on what I had learned at EKAS to document and interpret features and finds (for example, here). I also began to work with colleagues to used our digital tools to analyze the material from our survey work at EKAS (for example, here).\nWhen I started my own small project on Cyprus in 2003 (the Pyla-Koutsopetria Archaeological Project), I took a leading role in designing the databases, GIS, and digital workflow, although much of this was adapted from my previous experiences in EKAS. I also started a more digitally mediated project at Polis where we worked to build data structures that would allow us to query and analyze over 20 years of intensive excavation at the site. Finally, in 2014, I started to work with the folks at WARP to help with their data workflow.\nAt this point, I realized that the average archaeology graduate student had more experience using digital tools than I did and mostly what I was doing was workflow management rather than actual digital archaeology in any computational sense. I was perhaps slightly more savvy in dealing with the kind of big, structured datasets that archaeology produced, but, in the end, I was a dinosaur compared to their more agile ways of thinking with data and familiarity with the latest tools and techniques.\nWhat is the biggest challenge facing digital archaeology at the moment?  I’ve thought about this a good bit.\nAt first, I wanted to suggest that whatever center “digital archaeology” once existed, I’m increasingly inclined to say that it has currently dissipated. As a result, we’re not really dealing with “digital archaeology” as a field any longer, but “digital archaeologies” which cover a vast range of technologies, techniques, approaches, attitudes, and skill sets. For example, what Shawn does with agent-based-modeling, Andrew Reinhard does with archaeogaming, or Maurizio Forte does at his DIG@Lab is pretty different from, say, the work of Eric and Sarah Kansa at Open Context or work to refit legacy data to contemporary problems, or data collection in the field. This isn’t to imply that one type of digital archaeology is better than the other or that one is “real digital archaeology” or whatever, but to suggest that whatever big tent digital archaeology could be, the field is highly disparate at this point with many subfields and approaches having developed specialized bodies of literature and discussion. One wonders whether digital practices are now so diverse that many of them are largely incommensurate. In other words, perhaps the biggest challenge facing digital archaeology is determining whether “knowing it when you see it” or archaeological work that involves computers (i.e. Colleen Morgan and Stu Eve’s famous “we’re all digital archaeologists now”) remains enough to support the concept as meaningful in theory and practice. For more on this read Jeremy Huggett for more (and frankly better) thoughts on this.\nI then considered to talking about my own efforts to think about digital archaeology. I proposed the concept of “slow archaeology” as a way to think critically about digital practices. My ideas have evolved a bit over the last five years or so (read their latest iterations here), but they center on a concern for the impact of digital practices on the shape of archaeological labor. In other words, I consider how digital tools shape archaeological thinking and seeing from the survey unit and trench side to the lab and laptop. This felt odd solipsistic (and more than that, I know that Shawn and I don’t necessarily see eye-to-eye on this). It also is a pretty narrow view of what digital archaeology and even archaeology means in practice.\nIn an effort to avoid consuming my own tail (let’s say), I think I should propose that the greatest challenge facing digital archaeology/archaeologies at present is the continued need for sustained ethical reflection. While this applies to all archaeology, of course, I think that digital tools present distinct challenges. In fact, I would even propose that if digital archaeology has any center, it is in a shared ethics of practice. This could means a wide range of things, but I worry about this stuff the most:\n How do digital tools and digital practices reproduce hierarchy within the discipline? How have digital recording practices challenged ideas of heritage, ownership, and stewardship in our field? How do digital practices reinforce colonial relationships and support claims to universalism? What are our responsibilities toward digital ephemera and archival standards in everyday practice? What are the ethics of open access in practice? How do we understand critically the relationship between private profit and public good in the digital tools that we use? What are the ethics of digital workflows and efficiency? What are the ethics involved in selecting the material technologies that we use in the discipline? How do we understand and critique the asymmetries in funding associated with digital innovation? How do we critique the very concept of innovation in our field?  These issues are obviously overlapping and complex, and many of these issues have already attracted sustained and careful attention. At the same time, I think that we need to do more to consider how digital archaeologies are shaping the ethnical landscape of archaeological practice.\nWhat drives you up the wall about how digital archaeology is currently received/perceived in the profession? (Alternatively, what are you currently trying to learn in digital archaeology OR have you had any glorious failures, and so please describe.)  I usually don’t get easily perturbed by how others see me or my work, but I do worry that the public (and to a larger extent my less digitally focused colleagues and university administrators) continue to see digital archaeology as a field centered on innovation (or, if this was 2006 “disruption”).\nOf course, if you’ve read this far into this post, you will realize that I am guilty of this as well. In fact, my call for greater ethical scrutiny in the field assumes that somehow digital technology has made digital archaeology different from “analogue practice” and requires renewed critical attention.\nAt the same time, I get annoyed by the lack of interest and support for the small-scale iterative and adaptive practice that make technology work for archaeologists on a day-to-day level. Having read for any number of national grants over the last decade, it’s amazing how even among critical and thoughtful specialists in our field, we tend to be drawn to the projects that promise to re-invent the wheel at the expense of projects that seek to improve, modify, adapt, or reuse existing technologies to address new challenges.\nWhat fills you with hope about the field?  I often feel like digital archaeology (and digital humanities, digital history, and digital practices in general) encourage a kind of attention to day-to-day practices that non-digital versions of archaeology, humanities, history, and the like tend to approach as settled. For example, in my corner of archaeology, there’s relatively little discussion about how one excavates or analyzes finds. That is to say, we don’t talk much about troweling techniques, how we discern different strata in the field, and what we do determine and describe the shape, fabric, color, and function of ceramics during artifact analysis.\nDigital archaeology seems to have pushed us to think more critically about the little things that we do to create archaeological knowledge. Critical attention to digital tools has encouraged us to think more about how we produce an illustration, how we move about a landscape, and how we see architectural changes and strata. It may be that new technology will not radically change these practices in the long run, but it certainly feels like they’re receiving greater critical scrutiny these days as they intersect with an expanding range of digital tools.\nMaybe this is really what Morgan and Eve meant when they said “we’re all digital archaeologists now?” It doesn’t mean that we’re all on the bleeding edge of digital practices in our discipline or even regularly using technology in our practice, but that the emergence of the digital has made our past practices “analogue” and opened them to new forms of critique and reflection.\n","description":"This week, you should be continuing to do your graveyard survey. But I also want you to try to do some 3d photogrammetry; when we try to fit archaeological data into a recording scheme, or we try to take the 'right' kind of pictures to build a 3d model, we have to attend to the physicality of the remains in ways that make us think hard about what the act of recording does to knowledge creation. A digital close reading, if you will. In this week's episode, Bill Caraher of the University of North Dakota takes us through his reflections on what 'digital archaeologies' might mean for the nuts-and-bolts of doing archaeology.","id":34,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"Module 1 Episode 3","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/transcripts/episode-3/"},{"content":"Transcript of this week\u0026rsquo;s podcast episode.\nPart I My job was to copy the information in the paper recording sheets into the Access Database. Each box on the form had a count for a different type of pottery. Each paper form had a digital analog on my screen. I got pretty fast at running my finger down the paper form, and banging in numbers on the keypad. But every so often, there\u0026rsquo;d be a horrible warning noise: computer says no. There was a ware recorded on the form, but not provided for in the computer\u0026rsquo;s controlled vocabulary.\nComputer says no. And so\u0026hellip; that data did not get recorded.\nmusic\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve made it through the first module of the course. Congratulations! Archaeological work records data in many different ways. There is a tension between the ways we\u0026rsquo;ve always done the work, the tried-and-true field methods, and the methods that are opening more worlds of experience to archaeological investigation. In short, there are as many \u0026lsquo;digital archaeologies\u0026rsquo; as there are \u0026lsquo;regular\u0026rsquo; archaeologies. The way we choose to look at archaeological data - the things we decide to record- dictates a lot of what we might see.\nThe point of the work in this second module is to unpack what you\u0026rsquo;ve just completed in the light of this idea. No doubt you\u0026rsquo;ve encountered the phrase, \u0026lsquo;the act of observation changes that which is observed.\u0026rsquo; Terry Pratchett once noted that if it\u0026rsquo;s true to say that, it\u0026rsquo;s even more true to say that the thing observed also changes the observer. In archaeological terms, in data terms, this means that what gets counted, counts. The archaeology doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have meaning, until we go out and look for it.\nInsert puzzled Keanu meme here, eh?\nThis week, I want you to reflect on the ways the coding scheme we used for recording the graveyards failed. Then, I want you to take that scheme, modify it so that it\u0026rsquo;s better, and re-implement it. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to take it out and re-record everything (though you\u0026rsquo;re welcome to do that if you want). Rather, I want you to see how your choices intersect with the decisions already taken by the KoBoToolbox people to conspire to make your graveyard data observable.\nOther tasks this week can include getting to know a bit about the statistical sofware R and the programming environment R Studio, and a bit of futzing about with databases.\nPart II This week, we are joined by Dr. Colleen Morgan of the University of York, and Dr. Ben Carter of Muhlenberg College in Allentown PA.\nDr. Morgan Hi I\u0026rsquo;m Colleen Morgan I am the lecturer in Digital Archaeology and Heritage in the department of archaeology at the University of York and I also co-direct the digital archaeology digital heritage masters programs. My current projects are the \u0026lsquo;Aide Memoire project\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;The Other Eyes project\u0026rsquo;. Aide Memoire is all about digital reporting in Archaeology. It\u0026rsquo;s primarily about drawing and so really trying to understand what drawing is in archaeology and what it means that we are increasingly losing drawing within our archaeological toolkit. We\u0026rsquo;ve come on some really really interesting results as well. Needless to say, not only should we not stop drawing, continue drawing, but we should also be drawing more. More often, and probably during every single course you take. The other eyes project is about avatars in archaeology, so moving through is ethical for us to inhabit avatars of the past that are based on bioarchaeological remains and so that is continuing on; I\u0026rsquo;ll be presenting a paper on that soon. I got started in digital archaeology way back almost 20 years ago with Dr. Maria Franklin, working in Dallas TX on the Thomas and Nora Comb site. They wanted a website for this excavation and they somehow understood that I had a few digital skills and so I went ahead and digitized some of their old photos, I made a very very basic and now gone website for them and I\u0026rsquo;ve just been doing that ever since. So at a certain point they sorta shooed me to go and work inside. I was a bit sad about that.\nThe biggest challenge facing digital archaeology at the moment? I think really showing that critical and impactful discoveries can be made through digital archaeology is not always all that easy to prove to funders that you\u0026rsquo;re going to find out something new about the past through the application of digital methods because we don\u0026rsquo;t always know what that thing will be - because so much of it is through indirect investigation and playful approaches. And that\u0026rsquo;s what I really enjoy about it but it also can be difficult to find somebody to fund a lot of playing around. What drives me up the wall about how digital archaeology is currently received or perceived in the profession? I think going back to the Aide Memoire project - the way digital tools are used without understanding their impact on knowledge production in archaeology, without understanding what they\u0026rsquo;re doing to our mental models of how we interpret and disseminate archaeology. What fills me with hope about the field? I think the way people are using digital methods to fight fascism, to try to change the colonial basis on which archaeological investigation is built, I think that\u0026rsquo;s probably the most hopeful thing. I - me and a few others - have started a microgrants collective. It\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026lsquo;The Black Trowel Collective\u0026rsquo; and we give out microgrants to archaeology students from underserved communities and historically looted communities and so right now we\u0026rsquo;re centering Black and Trans archaeology students, to try to give them a little bit of help in this very majority white field. Thank you for inviting me to this Shawn and I hope you all have a good term!\nDr. Carter Good morning all! My name is Ben Carter; I\u0026rsquo;m an associate professor of Anthropology at Muhlenberg College in Allentown Pennsylvania.\nThe project I\u0026rsquo;m working on is actually fairly difficult to abbreviate. So what I\u0026rsquo;m looking at is charcoal production. Now that may sound silly and small but it was an extremely important industry here in Pennsylvania, mostly through the 19th century. It was largely for the iron industry; for producing iron it was the fuel that was used and in order to make charcoal you have to cut down a bunch of trees and convert them into charcoal which basically means you have to smoulder them for two weeks.\nThe way this was done was on flat spots of earth that are usually constructed, built by people - so you have this flat area, build a big pile of wood, cover it with dirt and then light it and it smoulders for a couple weeks and then you have charcoal!\nAnd so what the project I\u0026rsquo;m working on now is thinking about the lives of the colliers, the people who made this charcoal, and so one aspect of that - there\u0026rsquo;s many aspects of this - one aspect is using data that\u0026rsquo;s openly available from the state of Pennsylvania, from lidar surveys and lidar is when you basically fly a plane over the surface and shoot it with lasers that basically measures where the ground - it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more complicated than that but we don\u0026rsquo;t have time - and so we have all this data across the entire state of this sort of microscale topography and we are using that.\nOne of my students and I, Weston Connor, have gone through and manually right, looking, using a GIS (geographical information systems) and this data which we convert into a slope analysis. A slope analysis analysis just gives you a sort of - normally it\u0026rsquo;s lighter for steeper slopes and darker for flatter slopes - so we can see these flat areas on sloped surfaces, especially on mountains. And so we\u0026rsquo;ve been looking at the Blue Mountain which is just north of our school and we brought in one of Dr. Graham\u0026rsquo;s students, and Jeff Blackader is working to help us use this lidar across the entire state right and use this to look at the lidar of the entire state and use machine learning to recognize. Weston and I have done it all manually, we\u0026rsquo;ve recognized a couple thousand charcoal hearths on the landscape and Jeff is helping us take what we\u0026rsquo;ve done and train the machine to recognize it - it\u0026rsquo;s pretty fascinating. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you that at this point we\u0026rsquo;ve got tens of thousands of charcoal hearths across the landscape of Pennsylvania. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it at that even though that\u0026rsquo;s a fairly brief summary.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in some other stuff I have some data that has been published on Zenodo which is an archival service and you could check that out; there is also a wiki, wiki.IronAllentownPA.org and there\u0026rsquo;s actually a website that goes with that as well, the ironAllentownPA.org.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s a quick summary. Dr Graham also asked how did I get started in digital archaeology? That\u0026rsquo;s a combination of thinking about the responsibilities that we have to communities, both in presenting our data, right? Part of my digital archaeology is my website or my websites and they\u0026rsquo;re sorta outward-facing and people can see them and read them etcetera and these are non academics generally speaking. As well as collecting that data in a quick and efficient way - initially I thought digital archaeology would be an efficient way to record data - I don\u0026rsquo;t think that any more, it\u0026rsquo;s not particularly efficient. What it is, is, as long as you put in the time and effort - and again and you need to put in the time and effort - you can get some really clean data and that is particularly important. So that\u0026rsquo;s sorta where I started is, trying to use digital tools to start in the field and then of course there\u0026rsquo;s this explosion of lidar and I kind of got obsessed with looking at lidar, particularly in my own area seeing as how the the date is openly available.\nDr. Graham also asked, what is the biggest challenge facing facing digital archaeology at the moment? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I\u0026rsquo;m the one to ask that, but for me the biggest challenge at this point is honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s about geospatial data. Geospatial data is clunky and difficult to work with. It takes a long time to sort of figure out how to do this and I personally I think it needs to - that needs to be fixed and there\u0026rsquo;s a number of tools out there. Dr. Graham is I think using KoBoToolbox one of the pools that I\u0026rsquo;m particularly fond of, and again that helps provide clean data and that data is also easy to pull into maps and stuff. But archiving geospatial data, putting it up on the web and and visualizing it on the web- oof those are those are still quite difficult and so I think we need to do a lot more work there. Okay. Dr. Graham also asked, what drives me up the wall about digital archaeology as it is currently received/perceived by the profession? So digital archaeology in the broader profession of archaeology. I think the thing that drives me the most nuts is we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to have these data management plans in grants, and I\u0026rsquo;ve read many of them and there is literally no data management plan. But it\u0026rsquo;s sorta seen as, \u0026lsquo;ok\u0026rsquo;  They\u0026rsquo;re required but they\u0026rsquo;re not actually supported, and so the community doesn\u0026rsquo;t do a good job of supporting with what\u0026rsquo;s already required much less doing anything beyond that. For example I produced - I thought - a very nice data management plan and it was basically panned as sort of too elaborate and too much and we didn\u0026rsquo;t get the grant partly because there were too many details in the data management plan which I think is kinda mind-boggling but there it is.\nWhat fills me with hope about the field? Not surprisingly this is about my colleagues - so Dr. Graham being one - there\u0026rsquo;s so much going on and so much being communicated and often through platforms like Twitter and Facebook etc that it\u0026rsquo;s actually fairly difficult to keep up with my colleagues. I feel like I often spend half my time just keeping up with them, much less doing my own work! So I think that\u0026rsquo;s extremely hopeful and my I guess my hope in that is that because there\u0026rsquo;s so much that it will end up actually in broader archaeology and I think there\u0026rsquo;s some good signs that is in fact happening.\nAlright guys! Thank you all very much for listening I hope this was useful and yeah good luck!\n","description":"This week, we start 'Module 2: Considering/Critiquing'.

I want to tell you about the library at the British School at Rome. Imagine a room two stories tall, lined with bookshelves. There\u0026rsquo;s a walkway around where the second floor would be; you can go up a spiral steel staircase and browse those shelves up there, looking down on the scholars at their desks below. Each scholar in residence at the School has their favourite desk. People get quite attached to \u0026lsquo;their\u0026rsquo; space. The school faces to the west, and in the afternoons, the light slants in through the huge high windows, bathing everything in a sleepy yellow glow. But as night falls, the shadows get longer, the building starts to cool, and soon there are only small pools of light where the dedicated still labour at their desks. After supper, no one is in the library. But say you open the little wooden door and step into the vast shadowy darkness\u0026hellip; if you go up onto the upper walkway around about that time, and you wander over to the one bit of wall without any shelving, try placing a book on that empty shelf. You might look away if you hear something. When you look back, the book will be on the floor. They say the ghost of Eugenia Strong, once the assistant director of the school during WWII, still likes to work in the library at night, and uses this now blocked in doorway as her own personal entrance. She only throws the books over the edge.\nSo they say.\nPart I I want to talk to you about libraries.\nIf knowledge equals power, and power equals energy, and energy equals matter, and matter equals mass, then libraries are very dangerous places indeed. Not because they cause explosions, but because the explosions they cause happen inside your own head.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve read any of the works of Terry Pratchett, you\u0026rsquo;ll recognize that I\u0026rsquo;m talking about what Pratchett calls \u0026lsquo;L-Space\u0026rsquo;, one of the great secrets of Librarianship. In essence, all books everywhere affect all other books - thus you can deduce the contents of books not yet written.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s all pretty silly, but this week, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of truth in it. In fact, the main task for this week is to explore over 20 000 archaeological journal articles, written in English, from about 1935 to 2010 ish. You can\u0026rsquo;t possibly read all these articles. But you might be able to see macroscopic, large-scale trends in the things that these articles talk about. What I\u0026rsquo;ve done, in fact, is said to my computer: imagine there are 150 topics in these 20 000 articles. Please sort each article\u0026rsquo;s words into the most likely topics, and show me the results. So the computer looks at each word in each article, and its surrounding words, in each article, versus how that word is used in every other article. It imagines a world where writers pull words from different buckets in different proportions to write - and if you can imagine that, then you can get the computer to work backwards from the proportions to the original buckets.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve already done the computational part, although I have tutorials that will show you how to do this, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested. For making sense of more material than you can hope to read, a topic model is a great way to get this macroscopic view.\nI want you to pay attention to the visualizations that we can produce from the topic models; look for inflection points or other interesting blips. Dive into the data - the topic model browser will show you the individual articles, all of which are available through JSTOR. Can you identify the trends that lead to the emergence of \u0026lsquo;digital archaeology\u0026rsquo; as we understand it in this class? What about \u0026lsquo;computational archaeology\u0026rsquo; - is that something different from \u0026lsquo;digital archaeology\u0026rsquo;? If you need a framework to understand these inflection points, the Wikipedia article on \u0026lsquo;archaeological theory\u0026rsquo; is not a bad place to start.\nKnowledge = power = energy = matter = mass. Ideas become real because they dictate how we see and understand patterns in the material culture, and what we pay attention to and make real and end up calling \u0026lsquo;archaeology\u0026rsquo;.\nPart II Today we\u0026rsquo;re joined by Dr. Erin Averett of Creighton University.\nhello introduction to digital archaeology students! Your professor dr. Graham invited me to think about several key questions that I believe you will be addressing throughout the semester.\nI thought I\u0026rsquo;d start by introducing myself. My name is Erin Averett and I\u0026rsquo;m a professor of archaeology at Creighton University in Omaha Nebraska. I have excavated in North America, Greece, and Cyprus, but for the last 20 years I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with the Athienou Archaeological Project in Cyprus which is the easternmost island in the Mediterranean and I really like working there because it\u0026rsquo;s such an interesting mix of cultures and influences and it\u0026rsquo;s always changing so it\u0026rsquo;s always an exciting place to study. My current project is the publication of over a thousand fragments of terracotta figurines that were dedicated as votive offering at the large rural sanctuary that we\u0026rsquo;ve been excavating for the past 15 years. As our project has increasingly incorporated new 3D data into our recording processes we have begun to rethink that \u0026ldquo;gold standard\u0026rdquo; of the archaeological final report with catalogue and publication format. Despite innovations in relational databases, imaging, and online resources with linked open data, there is [not] as yet an agreed-upon replacement for the venerated and large printed final publication that represents the final interpretation of an archaeological site. And so as I work on publishing all of these figurines I\u0026rsquo;m considering new ways to publish our 3D models alongside illustrations and photographs as well as a database that can be continually updated and so in other words to challenge this idea of a final printed monograph that is the end, the goal of archaeological publication.\nDr. Graham ask me to speak about how I got started in digital archaeology. And to be honest one thing you should probably know about me is that I do not consider myself a digital archaeologist! I received a very traditional training in graduate school. When I was in graduate school there weren\u0026rsquo;t really any classes at all on digital archaeology or digital tools in my program - and I think that this is relatively common for most graduate programs in the 90s and 2000 across American institutions - so whatever we learned we had to pick up in the field. And obviously archaeologists have been using computers and databases and digital tools for quite a long time but it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t considered something worthy of study and a graduate classroom right, you kinda learned that on hand. So I\u0026rsquo;ve had to learn the digital tools that I need as I go, which has been very challenging. I\u0026rsquo;m continually impressed at how much training students at all levels can now get with digital technology and digital archaeology, and so this is a big change from just I think graduate training a decade ago.\nOur excavation on Cypress first started experimenting with new digital technologies as we followed the innovations of the Pompeii Porta Stabia project and others as they transitioned from traditional paper notebooks to digital notebooks on iPads. As the Athienou Archaeological Project tested and then adopted the digital notebook, which replaced our paper notebooks and used born-digital data, it forced me to really think about how the tools we use inform how we record process and even analyze and interpret the archaeological data. But the vast array of new digital tools now at our fingertips as they become cheaper and easier to use, this is only increasing and so I think archaeologists are now faced with many challenges as they struggle to adopt these tools in an effective, meaningful, and ethical way.\nSince our first experiments with digital notebooks we have started creating 3D models of some of our artifacts using structured light scanning and photogrammetry to record the trenches as they are being excavated and to create a 3D map of the sanctuary. So I guess you could say my start in digital archaeology was slow, informal and clumsy.\nThe next question that Dr. Graham posed is, what is the biggest challenge facing digital archaeology at the moment? That\u0026rsquo;s a very big question! You\u0026rsquo;re probably going to get a lot of different answers but from my point of view I see two major challenges. And the first one is that as we see the academic job market become more and more dire there is a widening divergence between what students are being trained to do to be good archaeologists in graduate school and what skills will get them the elusive tenure track jobs. What makes you a good archaeologist - things like specializing, knowing digital tools, being aware and knowing how to incorporate scientific advances in archaeology, GIS Etc - does not usually correspond in classical archaeology in the US at least to what search committees want: which is traditional training in Greek and Latin languages and the ability to teach the languages and standard culture courses. And so this is a disconnect right what makes you a good archaeologist doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make you a good job candidate and that\u0026rsquo;s a big problem.\nThe second challenge is that after the rapid adoption of digital tools and this is pretty standard right, it\u0026rsquo;s not unique to archaeology but when you have new technology people just experiment and try them out in different ways but archaeologists are only just now stepping back and considering larger issues of ethics and the epistemological implications of these new tools on our discipline. The good news is that there\u0026rsquo;s some really great scholarship that is considering these things now and I expect to see more and more scholars address these broader implications in the near future.\nThe fourth question was, what drives you up the wall about how digital archaeology is currently received or perceived in the profession? I think there is still a perception from scholars who don\u0026rsquo;t do it or who don\u0026rsquo;t read about it that digital archaeology is about knowing tech and that there\u0026rsquo;s very little intellectual value, interpretation or analysis in other words they don\u0026rsquo;t see the difference between IT and digital scholarship and research. Of course this is bonkers! but I think the number of people with this narrow and incorrect view is dwindling as some basic knowledge of how digital tools enhance research is now necessary and it\u0026rsquo;s becoming more commonplace.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to skip Professor Graham\u0026rsquo;s optional question about glorious failures. I\u0026rsquo;ll just say of course I\u0026rsquo;ve had them right? They\u0026rsquo;re great learning experiences but it would push me over my a minute allotment here so I\u0026rsquo;m going to end with addressing Dr. Graham\u0026rsquo;s last question and that is, what fills you with hope? And I think today younger scholars especially are forcing us all to really delve into the ethical issues in archaeology more generally but also in digital archaeology specifically. Studies on the ethnography of field work, ethics of data collection, access and publication, and digital appropriation and more, are forcing us all to think a lot more deeply about the impact of what we do and that\u0026rsquo;s a really important thing.\nAnd so thank you to Doctor Graham for the invitation to give these questions some more thought and to your students I hope that you enjoy the rest of your semester; thank you!\n","description":"In this week's episode, I reflect a bit on the nature of libraries. After all, a topic model is a kind of automagically generated index showing you the discourses hidden in the very pattern of words themselves. Some of these discourses presage/prefigure/predestine? trends that later become so big - like Digital Archaeology - that they warrant their own label.

Or rather, I wanted to call it \u0026lsquo;Practical Necromancy\u0026rsquo; but various folks felt that would be a bit off-putting. So instead, it ended up being called \u0026lsquo;An Enchantment of Digital Archaeology: Raising the Dead through Agent Based Models, Archaeogaming, and Artificial Intelligence\u0026rsquo;. It came out this past summer. The key idea in it, which I learned from the work and writing of Sara Perry, is the idea of \u0026lsquo;enchantment\u0026rsquo; as a mode of being open to the world. Why does this matter? Perry points out that a lot of archaeological work is driven by a crisis-mode vision of the world: everything is being destroyed, collect the archaeology before it\u0026rsquo;s being gone. We\u0026rsquo;ll worry about what it means later. Perry draws on the political theorist Jane Bennett who sees \u0026lsquo;enchantment\u0026rsquo; as a way to foster ethical engagement and care for the wider world. In archaeological terms, Perry sees that archaeological materials are the eruption of deep time into our every day world and so offer the potential to enchant us. Therefore, she writes,\n I believe archaeology can change the world for the better through its inherent and highly distinctive capacity to generate wonder and enchantment among human beings.\n Her advice to achieve enchantment is to \u0026lsquo;deliberately weave affective practices into all aspects of our archaeological methodologies and project designs, therein offering us a more contextual and dynamic model for doing, recording, interpreting, publicising and archiving archaeology.\u0026rsquo;\nFor me, this was an exciting article (it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026lsquo;The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record\u0026rsquo;, and it was published in the European Journal of Archaeology. Look it up.) It was exciting because for many years I have been disenchanted with archaeology. Disenchanted with how we do it, what we pay attention to, and how we write it, that faux-objective third person voice. I got into archaeology because it fired my imagination. It let me see through time! And then I graduated, and was unemployed/unemployable for 8 years.\nFor my book then, I wanted to examine what it was that I found enchanting about digital archaeology; and since this was a very personal perspective, it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;an enchantment\u0026rsquo;. I wanted to examine what was affective about doing digital archaeology. For me, it comes down to relationships. I can see relationships between individuals in the distant past, even if I don\u0026rsquo;t know who those individuals were. I can scale up those relationships, knitting them together into a network, and soon I can see the outlines of their social world. I can resurrect these networks in a simulation, and replay the past. Networks are capable of computation, and if treat for instance what someone wrote as a system of relationships (the probabilistic patterns of how they used words), I can resurrect their voice and have a conversation with them.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot more detail to it than that, but that\u0026rsquo;s the gist of it. This week, I want you to feel something of that enchantment. The tasks all are facets of a kind of digital necromancy - not just raising the dead, but raising them to understand something of the culture they were once part of. You\u0026rsquo;ll spot the idea of \u0026lsquo;the network\u0026rsquo; in many different ways in this week\u0026rsquo;s materials, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a literal network, or whether it\u0026rsquo;s a computational network that learns how to see.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s just one vision of the future of digital archaeology. The readings this week will give you other perspectives. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s all just phygital.\nPart Two Raising the dead is of course a kind of simulation. This week we\u0026rsquo;re joined by Dr. Iza Romanowska, formerly of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and now at the University of Aarhuus in Denmark. Dr. Romanowska specializes in simulation and data science.\nHi everyone! My name is Iza Romanowska and I am a digital archaeologist working mostly on agent based simulations. I also do some data science from time to time and other types of simulations. I was asked by Shawn to have a few words with you and there\u0026rsquo;s a series of questions that I will try to honestly answer.\nAlright - who am I? So at the moment I\u0026rsquo;m still the head of the social science, simulation, and digital Humanities research group at the Barcelona supercomputing Center but in about a week\u0026rsquo;s time I start a new position as a fellow at the Aarhus Institute of advanced studies in Aarhus Denmark and I\u0026rsquo;m currently working on two projects. I look at the demographics of Palmyra so you might have heard of it - mostly because Isis managed to blow up that amazing archaeological site - [it\u0026rsquo;s] located in the middle of a desert where people had more cash than they should if you ask me and so they spend their cash on all sorts of weird reasons; one of which was basically tombs and portraits and now thanks to them doing that and thanks for the find of the portraits because they were carved in stone so they preserve pretty well we have this amazing source of data in terms of funerary activity among Palmyra\u0026rsquo;s elite. So I look at this data and currently I\u0026rsquo;m just I\u0026rsquo;m just doing data analysis on it, seeing how the patterns in the data show ebbs and flows of the population in Palmyra. So that\u0026rsquo;s one project. But I also work on covid-19 like literally every single scientist in the world it seems. So my second project that I worked on right now is related to the contact tracing app and how can we establish whether it is going to work in terms of false positives and false negatives. So you\u0026rsquo;ve probably heard of those kinds of apps, pretty much every government has released one and they\u0026rsquo;re all based on the same engine but the thing is because we don\u0026rsquo;t have any data - they really do not collect any data about a user or the locations - we have no means of establishing what is the percentage of notifications that basically are false positives or false negatives. And that means that we use simulation to try to figure that and establish if it is worth doing it. The fact that you\u0026rsquo;re an archaeologist doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you won\u0026rsquo;t be doing projects that are related to non archaeology! So this is something where having digital skills actually actually help with massively.\nAlright so how did I get started in digital archaeology? I went to a workshop, they taught me how to do simulations and I thought, yeah, yeah, we should probably be doing it, so I\u0026rsquo;ll just do it. So that was a pretty quick story!\nWhat is the biggest challenge facing digital archaeology at the moment? I think mostly the fact that people are lazy and not digital archaeologists, archaeologists in general! And they\u0026rsquo;re lazy in the sense that it\u0026rsquo;s so much easier to write an essay about something than to actually count things - I\u0026rsquo;m not even asking for statistical analysis - counting would be a first great step and then plotted and then maybe actually run some analysis and see whether it\u0026rsquo;s significant or not AND on the off chance people had loads of time you could for example formalize hypothesis and test them against those amazing patterns you get out of analysis. This is obviously something in digital archaeology we do a lot not because we\u0026rsquo;re better but because we\u0026rsquo;ve got the tools so we can actually do it. I think that the challenge is that it\u0026rsquo;s just so much more work and it\u0026rsquo;s highly frustrating, just compared to writing random thoughts about stuff and given that a lot of people build their career on writing random thoughts about stuff it is hard to convince the rest of them that this is not how we should progress. So I think this is the biggest challenge basically, getting people to do the work properly. By the way writing random thoughts about stuff is still useful, just less useful than writing non-random thoughts about stuff.\nWhat drives me up the wall about how digital archaeology is currently received/perceived in the profession? Well, yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s that, it\u0026rsquo;s that people that basically had some kind of idea thing this an equivalent to thorough scientific study of that topic which obviously is not. But also there is one thing that really really annoys me which is perceiving people with very solid computation skills as technicians. As if reading a few articles in a few books and then thinking about something makes you a scholar but if you know techniques for data science that take years to learn then you\u0026rsquo;re just as IT person. That\u0026rsquo;s not the case, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of scholarship in this kind of work as well.\nSo what fills me with hope about the field? Two things. One thing is that most of the funding nowadays is either four stem subjects which means we have to pretend to be one or for they\u0026rsquo;re generally open to all disciplines, like the funding landscape doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like arts, humanities can carry on on their own. And that means that, you have to use the right methods, you have to use proper scientific methods because otherwise you\u0026rsquo;re not going to get the money. so it kind of process of natural evolution and then, you know survival of the fittest, survival of the of the funded, sooner or later computational archaeology, not as a field but as a necessary techniques to do any scientific research will basically win over other types, and that fills me with hope I just hope this happens in my lifetime because I truly don\u0026rsquo;t care that much about what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen to the next generation; a little bit, but not that much. I think this has to shift because things shift, and it\u0026rsquo;s shifted in so many other disciplines, it\u0026rsquo;s shifted in biology, in geography, and so many social sciences are on the way so we\u0026rsquo;re basically the next in line and after we do it I think historians will actually move their bums towards counting things so that\u0026rsquo;s very exciting so I\u0026rsquo;m glad you guys are taking this class because you will be at the forefront of a grand revolution in the humanities, and I hope you have a lovely day and a lovely rest of the class\n","description":"","id":37,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"Module 2 Episode 3","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/transcripts/m2-episode-3/"},{"content":"Transcript of this week\u0026rsquo;s podcast episode.\nPart One I love Phineas and Ferb, and I empathize so much with Dr. Doofenschmirtz. Look at him, out there every day, building new devices and clearly communicating what they do, how they do it, his plans and everything. He might not be an effective evil villain, but he\u0026rsquo;s a very good communicator.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now in the final third of this course, which I\u0026rsquo;ve called \u0026lsquo;Communicating\u0026rsquo;. There are lots of different contexts in which we share archaeological data, and lots of different ways to achieve that. Lots of different \u0026lsquo;publics\u0026rsquo;, too!\nIn this week\u0026rsquo;s materials, we\u0026rsquo;re looking at the ways archaeologists inform each other about their work, share their data, and the \u0026lsquo;open science\u0026rsquo; movement, which aims for both reproducibility and replicability. Reproducible research means that if I provide you my data and show you my analytical methods, you can arrive at the same results that I did; replicability means that you can use a different approach on different data to find the same observation (ie, if two different teams took different samples from the same wooden artefact and used different dating methods, they\u0026rsquo;d arrive at the same date.)\nThe idea that archaeological research could be reproducible or replicable is quite new in the discipline, and runs parallel with efforts to make archaeological work more widely available via things like \u0026lsquo;open access publishing\u0026rsquo;, making results and data free-to-read. Given that a lot of archaeological work is publicly funded, this only seems appropriate, but the publishing oligarchies have managed to pervert this by charging exorbitant \u0026lsquo;article processing fees\u0026rsquo;, and then selling access to the journals anyway by bundling them with non OA-titles. But I digress.\nI generally believe that making my research and my results open access is a moral imperative. But it\u0026rsquo;s worth taking a moment and reflecting on what can happen when OA intersects the \u0026lsquo;real world\u0026rsquo;. I want to tell you about what happened once when my own research escaped my control, which underlins that there are situations where the greater good may be served by not making our work fully open.\nLong story short, our research on the human remains trade got picked up in the slow summer months by journalists, because human remains are \u0026lsquo;exotic\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;macabre\u0026rsquo;, and make good copy.\nThen, in the run-up to the federal election, a political candidate bought a human skull as a gift for her boyfriend.\nAPTN, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, broke the story and asked me for comment, having seen the other newspaper articles, and again, having read our work. The APTN story was taken up by lots of other outlets, both in Canada and internationally. Suddenly, there were interview requests everywhere. Our work even made it into Wired magazine (the politician did not). But, in trying to be ‘balanced’, it seems, the story included interviews w collectors. And they made the editorial decision to embed in the story actual posts from Instagram selling human remains.\nThat story was picked up and re-worked across multiple outlets, including the Sun, Britain\u0026rsquo;s biggest tabloid. But in that version, we’d been erased from the research, and the nuance we try for in our work was completely lost. But the collectors sure got a lot of oxygen! More of their posts were added to the stories.\nBy the way, when a number of outlets contacted us, for interviews, including the BBC, they requested that we also put them in touch with collectors. I refused to do this. If we were studying sex trafficking, would you ask us to put you in touch with pimps?\nAs our research got out there, the humans who had been collected and we the researchers and our scholarly goals got gradually erased in favour of the sensational sound bites from the people doing the bone trading.\nAnd so, with the press attention, and the celebration of the ‘eccentric’ collectors, how much traffic did we inadvertently drive to collectors? By publishing our findings openly, to what degree did we help promote the trade we are studying? Since we know bone traders actually do read our work (we\u0026rsquo;ve seen posts of them discussing it), how have we changed their behaviour to enhance their ability to trade without prying eyes?\nThese human remains were collected in morally, ethically, legally dubious circumstances. To reduce them to clickbait is to return us to the era of ‘human zoos’. How many times will these people be dehumanized? But… we published OA. We put our material out there.\nThe human remains trade in its origins is part of the literal flow of human bodies from around the world into the West. As the archaeologist Priscilla Ulguim reminds us, \u0026lsquo;we are sometimes at risk of sharing information which isn\u0026rsquo;t ours to share: to avoid this issue our stakeholders should be the people advising on ethical concerns and leading the process of opening our data.\u0026rsquo; A binary approach to open access assumes I have the right to share; but that\u0026rsquo;s not always true, and the contexts are complex.\nI am also from the global north, the consumer of these bodies, of these data. Unthinking OA allows me to profit academically from these bodies one more time.\nBefore I was a prof, being able to read and look at open access data let me play at being an archaeologist. Now on the other side, I want to get my research out there: but naive OA, especially in archaeology, is not without its risks, as this episode has demonstrated. \u0026lsquo;Open access\u0026rsquo; should not be understood in binary terms, but rather as a complicated spectrum, and ideally the decision to be open needs to be taken by more than just the researchers.\nPart Two This week, we\u0026rsquo;re joined by Dr. Ethan Watrall of Michigan State University.\nHi there my name is professor Ethan Watrall and this is my interview - my self-interview- for Professor Shawn Graham\u0026rsquo;s digital archaeology class\nok first question: who am I and what am I currently working on. Alright so let\u0026rsquo;s start with the who am I. As many people know who were friends and colleagues I wear a lot of hats some of those hats overlap to be to be sure; first and foremost I am an associate professor in the department of anthropology at Michigan State University. I\u0026rsquo;m associate director of MATRIX Center for digital Humanities and social sciences which is our big DH centre and one of the oldest dh centres in North America. I\u0026rsquo;m director of the cultural heritage informatics initiative which is essentially a project based out of the Department of anthropology that is intended to that is designed to capacitate graduate students undergraduates and existing professionals with digital methods and computational approaches in archaeology and heritage. I\u0026rsquo;m also director of the DHI lab in the department of anthropology which is digital Heritage Imaging and innovation lab. The DHI lab is a sort of a joint partnership between LEADR (the lab for education and advancement in digital research at Michigan State University) and the department of anthropology. DHI Lab is essentially interested in providing a space and supporting research, specifically preservation and access in digital Heritage and digital archaeology (mostly material culture oriented, do a lot of digitization, 3D stuff, building digital repositories in archives, things like that). So that\u0026rsquo;s mostly me. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a couple of other hats but they\u0026rsquo;re not important in this in this context.\nSo what am I working on? I\u0026rsquo;m always working on a billion different things some of which are more \u0026lsquo;baked\u0026rsquo; than others but of the things that are mostly on my plate right now are the IADA which is the Internment Archaeology Digital Archive my colleague Dr. Stacey Camp and I recently received quite a large grant from the National Park Service to build a digital archive that would preserve and provide access to and contextualize material culture from internment camps that held Japanese-American citizens during the Second World War in the United States. I\u0026rsquo;m also collaborating with a wonderful staff at Jame\u0026rsquo;s Madison\u0026rsquo;s Montpelier - James Madison, former President of the United States, his plantation, his property on the Montpelier digital collections initiative and I\u0026rsquo;m collaborating with a lot of really really great people there but mostly Mary Furlong Minkoff who is the curator of collections at Montpelier and we\u0026rsquo;re interested in basically building a digital repository of digitized materials not just archaeological materials but historic architectural materials, historic materials, museum materials from their Collections and it\u0026rsquo;s not just about digitization it\u0026rsquo;s also about access and in particular how do we collaborate equally and equitably with the Descent Community, those people who are descended from people who were held in slavery on the plantation. There were 300 people that James Madison and his family owned and many of these descendants are deeply involved in the James Madison plantation now - Montpelier- and collaborating with people so that the project is not just about digitization and building digital archives but it\u0026rsquo;s also about equitable and equal collaboration and partnerships with the descent community.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also working with colleagues here at Michigan State University to come up with a workflow and a platform for both rapid and mass digitization project of all the archaeological collections held at Michigan State University. I\u0026rsquo;m finishing up fingers crossed and edited volume with my colleague Lynne Goldstein. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be published at University Press Florida called \u0026lsquo;Digital Heritage and Archaeology In Practice\u0026rsquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a an edited volume that is both going to be physical and open digital and that is intended to basically as the name suggests, discuss digital heritage in practice - what are people doing, what are the challenges, right, it\u0026rsquo;s not just a show-and-tell but it\u0026rsquo;s also about how we wrestle with the very practical problems that many of us in the field such as it is encounter every day. So those are the big things on my on my plate right now; I mean, there\u0026rsquo;s certainly a lot of grants, I spend a massive amount of my time writing grants, so that\u0026rsquo;s always in the background but those are the sort of the major a big things.\nArlight question number 2, how did I get into digital archaeology? Like many people I sort of wandered into it sideways. I guess I\u0026rsquo;m of a generation where disciplinarily there were no programs for digital archaeology and heritage, they didn\u0026rsquo;t exist. There are now so I sort of come before that. I had always been computationally inclined has a kid growing up right, programming on a VIC-20, Commodore-64, and as an undergraduate at the University of Regina I got particularly interested in how computers can be used in the context of archaeaology, sorta played around with it a little bit but I didn\u0026rsquo;t really sort of dive headfirst into the the domain until I was a graduate student. My dissertation is purely an archaeological dissertation, not computational in any way shape or form - basically I looked at households in predynastic Egypt and the role that they played in the local economy at at one particular side called Hierakopolis in Upper Egypt. Nothing computational at all! But as I worked through my graduate career I started leaning more towards people digital methods and computational approaches and fell sideways into it. And while I\u0026rsquo;m a trained anthropological archaeologist, y\u0026rsquo;know, worked through North America worked through North Africa, Egypt, the Sudan, I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself a field archaeologist anymore. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a field program. My primary research, my primary work, is in digital archaeology and in Heritage and my interests are mostly publicly engaged, digital archaeology and heritage.\nokay 3, \u0026lsquo;what is the biggest challenge facing digital archaeology at the moment?\u0026rsquo; The answer to this question is obviously going to vary from person to person giving their own particular sort of bent and their own particular perspective. I have two that I think are particularly challenging to the domain of digital archaeology and Heritage. the first is that when you talk to people about digital archaeology, if you look at the spectrum, if you look the field there\u0026rsquo;s an awful lot of big money, big infrastructure, expensive equipment, highly technical processes and as such there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of a barrier there right? I\u0026rsquo;m constantly frustrated that the only sort of conception of digital archaeology and heritage is one that is inaccessible to most people because it\u0026rsquo;s expensive, it\u0026rsquo;s technical, it requires incredibly burdensome financially equipment, it requires really really expensive infrastructure and you know to that I would counter the need to think about digital archaeology and heritage also being - not exclusively being, but also being - nimble and quick experimental and \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; instead of perfect.\nThe other thing that sort of concerns me, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, biggest challenge, is a simplistic approach to openness. I\u0026rsquo;m a very very copyleft scholar. I believe in open culture and openness very very strongly. For a lot of good reasons however openness is really complicated - really complicated! Ppatrimony, copright, openness, especially in an Indigenous context, especially in a descent community context, basically this idea of \u0026lsquo;who owns the past?\u0026rsquo; and the legacies of colonialism that are sort of trickling into digital archaeology method and practice. And that complexity often encourages some to think about openness as binary - you\u0026rsquo;re either open or you\u0026rsquo;re closed - and that\u0026rsquo;s something that I take, I have a problem with. I would argue that openness exist on a spectrum and that you can be thoughtfully open, \u0026ldquo;thoughtful open\u0026rdquo; is a term that I use a lot in my work and when I talk to students. You can be thought you can be thoughtfully open while still being mindful, respectful, consultative, with the descent communities, the owners of the materials if it\u0026rsquo;s material culture for instance. So this idea that openness is binary, you\u0026rsquo;re either open you\u0026rsquo;re closed, openness can exist along the spectrum that is informed by the local conditions is really important to me and something that I argue about a lot with with people.\nOkay four, \u0026lsquo;what drives you up the wall about how digital archaeology is currently received or perceived in the profession?\u0026rsquo; I mean both of those challenges are things that drive me drive me up the wall; I mean there are certainly lots of other things but those are two certainly two big things.\nLast question, \u0026lsquo;what fills me with hope about the field?\u0026rsquo; I mean there\u0026rsquo;s lot that fills me with hope about the field. But quite honestly one of the biggest things is projects that are not sort of technologically fetishist, that are serving a greater purpose, right? In particular digital heritage, heritage and archaeology projects that are serving the needs of communitiesm that are community-engaged, that are community first, and serving the needs of those communities ethically, responsibly, and equitably. Really, I\u0026rsquo;m seeing more and more of these projects that are taking this wonderful spectrum of digital methods and computational approaches and then wrapping them, those methods, in ethical protocols, right? You know, in community-engaged protocols. I mean we\u0026rsquo;re not there yet by any stretch of the imagination because archaeology as a discipline at this point is not there yet by any stretch of the imagination but I\u0026rsquo;m really really encouraged by digital heritage and archaeology projects that are community engaged and that are really serving that community whether it\u0026rsquo;s an Indigenous community, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a Descent community, whether it\u0026rsquo;s you know any other kind of community.\nOkay so those are are my y five questions! I hope that you have enjoyed my sort of very very brief self-interview here and I really thank you for your time!\n","description":"","id":38,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"Module 3 Episode 1","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/transcripts/m3-episode-1/"},{"content":"Transcript of this week\u0026rsquo;s podcast episode.\nPart One A number of years ago, I found some contract work with a small online liberal arts college in the United States. When I say small, I mean: there were 3 of us. So we each got to wear different hats on a rapidly shifting basis. Sometimes I taught, sometimes I tried to fix the learning management system. Sometimes I was writing code to sort out our online registration system. It was\u0026hellip; an education. The nice thing about being such a small team was that if one of us had a bright idea, there was no one to say \u0026lsquo;I dunno, should you really be trying that?\u0026rsquo; And so it was that I obtained a parcel of \u0026lsquo;land\u0026rsquo; in the online persistent social world of \u0026lsquo;Second Life.\u0026rsquo;\nThere was a lot of buzz around Second Life in those days: many thought it would be the future of online education. Many universities were pouring serious money into virtual campuses, imposing architecture, classes inside virtual lecture rooms. In a space where it was possible to do anything, be anyone - my own avatar looked a bit like Frankenstein\u0026rsquo;s Monster - the big money was just trying to replicate the spaces we were already familiar with.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t want that. I wanted a virtual excavation. I wanted to be able to offer our students a taste of how archaeologists construct knowledge from physical remains. So I built a Mithraeum, a ruined temple to the god Mithras, patterned after the Mithraeum discovered in London (back in the 50s, I think that was). Then I covered it with different \u0026lsquo;layers\u0026rsquo; and put some code into each one: if a student\u0026rsquo;s avatar touched the layer, it would fly up into the sky, each one in turn slightly lower than the last so that the stratigraphy would be visible.\nThen, I started salting the excavation with artefacts. At first, these were just cubes and spheres; then I figured out that I could link these cubes and spheres to websites, and have the information display inside Second Life.\nAnd then I discovered Open Context, an archaeological data publisher. So I linked to actual archaeological materials, and dispersed them around the site in cunning arrangements. What I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize, was that I was putting a serious load on the server for Open Context, and that Open Context was largely a two person show. About four or five days later I received an email that read, \u0026lsquo;Who is this? You\u0026rsquo;re screwing up my server!\u0026rsquo;\nAnd that is how I met Sarah and Eric Kansa, whom you will hear from in a moment. Open Context is one of the pioneers for getting actual archaeological information onto the web in a form that permits re-use and re-examination. And for someone like me, who at the time did not have access to the field, it was a godsend. Open data enabled me to participate in the archaeological world.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t emphasize enough how revolutionary this is.\nThis week, you\u0026rsquo;ll read about a variety of projects that not only push materials onto the web, but also celebrate, promote, and depend on the knowledge of communities, using the web to crowdsource those materials. The exercises this week explore this push / pull dynamic, from participating in some crowdsourcing to building your own research compendium and sharing it.\n","description":"Crowdsourcing and other shennanigans","id":39,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"Module 3 Episode 2","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/transcripts/m3-episode-2/"},{"content":"Transcript of this week\u0026rsquo;s episode.\nPart One This is it, gang. The end! You\u0026rsquo;ve made it through. Take a moment, and look back at everything you\u0026rsquo;ve done this term. Look at your glorious failures. Look at your spectacular successes. Each one of you has at least one of both! You\u0026rsquo;ve come a long way, as the advertisement used to have it.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re ending the term by looking at digital creativity, computational creativity, gaming, and augmented reality. I firmly believe that creative engagement with the past opens our perception to understanding more about the past than what we might first believe to be possible. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in sonification, for instance, but not just hearing the past, but remixing it, too. Sonification maps aspects of the information against things like timbre, scale, instrumentation, rhythm, and beats-per-minute to highlight aspects of the data that a visual representation might not pick up. It’s also partly about making something strange—we’ve become so used to visual representations of information that we don’t necessarily recognize the ways assumptions about it are encoded in the visual grammars of barcharts and graphs. By trying to represent historical information in sound, we have to think through all of those basic decisions and elaborate on their implications. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in trying it out, let me know; there\u0026rsquo;s a tutorial on the Programming Historian website that\u0026rsquo;ll get you started.\nThe opening music for this podcast is a sound based representation of archaeological data, by the way. It\u0026rsquo;s built on 2000 rows of data from the excavations at the Italian site of Poggio Civitate. I built chords by translating the latitude and longitude and the counts of objects for different classes of objects onto relative positions on the 88 key keyboard. Then, archaeologist Andrew Reinhard remixed these sonic representations to represent how archaeological materials interpenetrate in the soil matrix. In the beginning, they are harmonious and in time, but because of subtle variations in bpm, by the time the song ends the data have become messy and frenetic, a reflection of the scattered pieces within the archaeological record, something that happens over time. Each movement in the song corresponds to an isolated data thread, which then loops back in with the others to see how they relate.\n3,000 years ago, at a plateau in the tufa landscape of southern Etruria, people lived their lives, only to have their debris carefully collected, studied, systematized, counted, digitized, and exposed online. No longer things but data, these counts and spaces were mapped to simple sonic dimensions using a web-toy, making a moderately pleasing experience. Remixed, the music moves us, enchants us, towards pausing and thinking through the material, the labour, the meanings, of a digital archaeology. If/when this song is performed in a club, the dancers would then be embodying our archaeological knowledge of Poggio in their movements, in the flows and subtle actions/reactions their bodies make across the floor. In dancing, we achieve a different kind of knowledge of the world, that reconnects us with the physicality of the world. The eruptions of deep time into the present – such as that encountered at an archaeological site – are weird and taxing and require a certain kind of trained imagination to engage with. But by turning the data into music, we let go of our authority over imagination, and let the dancers perform what they know.\nUsing the new music bridges the gap between humans past and present and in dancing we (and hopefully you) embody the data we present. It’s a new connection to something old, and is experienced by bodies. Archaeology is often a cerebral enterprise, which deserves—at times—a good ass-shaking derived from a driving beat.\nPart Two This week, we are joined by Dr. Katherine Cook of the University of Montreal.\n","description":"","id":40,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"Module 3 Episode 3","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/transcripts/m3-episode-3/"},{"content":"Introduction Gif by Alex Mordvintsev showing how neural networks \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo;; a higher resolution version is available here.\nWhen our eyes see an image, various receptors in the retina respond by firing. Some fire in response to various colours. Some fire in response to light and shadow. Imagine that these cells are arranged in layers. If those simple cells in the first layer fire, they pass a signal to the next layer up. The cells in that layer might only fire if they get enough \u0026lsquo;activations\u0026rsquo; from the previous layer. Each layer in turn receives the input of more and more complicated patterns of connections from the previous layer. Eventually, the brain receives the signal.\nA biologist might read that paragraph, and shudder. Neural networks have long been around in the field of artificial intelligence, and they\u0026rsquo;ve been modelled after that simple analogy. Since about 2012 or so, the field of neural networks has exploded with the raw computing power of commercial grade GPUs. The key to the recent explosion has been this combination of raw computing power, large million image datasets, and the idea of allowing inputs to back propogated along the network: basically, if you put enough images of a dog in front of the neural network, the average pattern of connection and firing could be labelled \u0026lsquo;dog\u0026rsquo;; then if a picture of, say, a cat was put in front of the network, the distance or similarity of the firing could be compared to that we know for \u0026lsquo;dog\u0026rsquo; and a score computed. Put enough pictures of cats in front of the neural network, and the network learns what \u0026lsquo;cats\u0026rsquo; look like.\nI simplify enormously, of course, but that\u0026rsquo;s the gist. The neat thing is, once you\u0026rsquo;ve got a network trained on thousands of different kinds of things - which takes enormous computing power and resources - you can retrain just the last layer of the network with new data, to teach it what something looks like that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t trained on. Retrain the network on pictures of Roman pottery, and it will learn what different kinds of Roman pottery look like (but you can\u0026rsquo;t use it for dogs any more). The network lights up in a particular way when it encounters pictures of verenice nera, and we can say: this pattern = verenice nera, with a given probability.\n(For a discussion on the use of neural networks in archaeology, see Baxter 2014).\nIndeed, you don\u0026rsquo;t even need to have labelled categories of things for a pretrained neural network to be useful. The Yale DH Lab uses a neural network without that final layer to find image similarity: it shows images to the network, and computes the distance between how the network lights up for one image versus a different image. This distance can then be expressed in two-dimensional space, and you end up with a visualization of visual similarity! See their repository here.\nExercise In this exercise, you\u0026rsquo;re going to re-train a neural network on a small dataset of Roman pottery images.\n  In our course repository I have created a notebook containing all of the code necessary to build a simple image classifier that you will train on some Roman pottery wares. Hit the blue \u0026lsquo;open in colab\u0026rsquo; button. The notebook assumes you have a Google drive account. You will need to upload the image data zipped folder (clicking the link should start a download to your machine).\n  Read the notebook carefully, and make sure to run each cell in sequence, letting a cell complete before you run the next one. Also, you need to make sure that the notebook settings for hardware acceleration are set to \u0026lsquo;gpu\u0026rsquo; (see the getting started block in the notebook).\n  ","description":"The Automated Archaeologist","id":41,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Neural Networks \u0026 Computer Vision","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/7/computer-vision/"},{"content":"If any of the instructions below are unclear, annotate this page with hypothesis while being logged into our course reading group.

Ask a family member or other person in your \u0026lsquo;bubble\u0026rsquo; to go along with you.\nThis project is inspired by the DEBS: Discovering England\u0026rsquo;s Burial Spaces project.\nInstructions   Locate a local graveyard - historic or otherwise - and obtain permission to study the stones. A cemetery currently being used is probably the easiest place to work, as people are expected to be present, whereas historic graveyards might be on private land.\n  Devise a short id code for the graveyard. Archaeological sites in Canada are enumerated using a \u0026lsquo;Borden number\u0026rsquo; based roughly on the latitude and longitude of the site. We won\u0026rsquo;t use a Borden number (it\u0026rsquo;s entirely possible of course that a graveyard might actually have a Borden number if it was ever excavated or added to an inventory). For our purposes, devise a 4 letter code that abbreviates the common name for the graveyard. Eg., Norway Bay United Cemetery could be nwuc.\n  Follow the instructions on making a quick sketchmap to sketch out the portion of the graveyard (or the whole thing, if it\u0026rsquo;s not too big) that you are working in. Number each grave with a sequential series of numbers that incorporate the graveyard id code, eg nwuc-01, nwuc-02, etc.\n  We’ll use this scheme - http://debs.ac.uk/files/CodeSheets.pdf - to codify our observations for entry into our recording system. I would suggest that you print it out, staple it together, and bring it with you.\n  The numbering system builds up to describe a stone, monument, or tomb. For instance, in the illustration below, 1126, each digit is significant. The first 1 indicates chest and table tombs, the next two digits differentiate between chest tomb with plain sides (11) and chest tomb with rectangular panelled sides, 12, and then the final digit describes the decoration on the top, 6, what is called a double bale. Headstones begin with 4 and the combination of digits can be used to describe quite complex shapes and motifs.\nThen, record the stone \u0026amp; the inscription with this: https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/uIGvnNmd. It works best with Chrome. Deciding precisely which numbers best describe what you are observing will be a challenge. As you work, make a note of problems you encounter with the scheme - what assumptions are literally encoded that do not seem to reflect what you are seeing? Are there shapes that just don\u0026rsquo;t seem to fit?  Before you go out to the graveyard These forms can be used for off-line data recording. Open the link on a smartphone or tablet when you are connected to wifi or data. On the top right of most mobile browsers, there\u0026rsquo;s a button you can click for options; one of these will be \u0026lsquo;add to home screen\u0026rsquo;  You fill in as many of the fields as possible, but make sure to always add the ID for the graveyard and for the stone in question. The location field will try to automatically get your location from your device; the plus-minus on this can be quite variable. Do take a photograph (there is a field that will do that). When you press the submit button at the bottom of the form, the results will be queued and saved locally in your device, and then you can record the next stone. Once you turn data on or are back in wifi range, your results will upload automatically to the server.\n  You can record the personal information on the stones with this form, which works in the exact same way: https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/vFoK4DMY\n  I am imagining that recording between 5 and 10 stones will be feasible for you to do over the course of this week and next.\nYour data will upload to a server that I have access to, and be collated with the work of everyone else in the class.

Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. \u0026lsquo;Git\u0026rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state. It also allows you to create branches, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can merge that branch back into your original.\nGithub therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.\nA branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a fork); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I\u0026rsquo;ve pulled it). Once I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my changes, I commit them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could push those changes to the fork in my account. I would then send you a pull request or notification, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to merge.\nFor our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work. I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won\u0026rsquo;t happen very often. It takes a while to get comfortable with this.\nGet your account  Got to github.com and sign up for an account. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)  Verify your account.  Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, stop and ask for help).  Skip telling Github anything about yourself.  Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you\u0026rsquo;ll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:  Give it a reasonable name; tick the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme\u0026rsquo; box, tick off the \u0026lsquo;private\u0026rsquo; box, and hit the green commit button. (Nb It\u0026rsquo;s your choice to choose public OR private):  And on the final page, hit the \u0026lsquo;dismiss\u0026rsquo; button in the \u0026lsquo;Github Actions box\u0026rsquo;  Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you\u0026rsquo;ve created your first repository. Going Forward create a new repository for each week\u0026rsquo;s work/reflection. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:\nnb Remember to tick off the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme.md\u0026rsquo; file.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at your Github user page:\nAdd me as a collaborator to this and subsequent private repositories:   Private Repo: Then, once you\u0026rsquo;ve clicked on \u0026lsquo;manage access\u0026rsquo;, click on \u0026lsquo;invite collaborator\u0026rsquo;,\n  Private Repo: Then find my username shawngraham, and add me:\n  Setting up a \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; for your work A \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; is just a folder that you\u0026rsquo;ve shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have already done the easy way - you selected the initialize with a readme, and it\u0026rsquo;s already present in your browser!\nTo create new repositories, just click on the + button on the top right of your Github page when you\u0026rsquo;re logged in. You might want to go ahead now and create repositories for week 2 through to week 12. Remember to tick off the initialize with a readme box. Remember to make them private. But if you didn\u0026rsquo;t tick the initialize box, you\u0026rsquo;ve embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I\u0026rsquo;m looking at this page:\nIf this is you, do not despair.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to initialize a new repo: You\u0026rsquo;re going to have to install one or two things, and do some work at the command prompt or terminal.\n If you have a PC, click on this link to download and install git. Just use all of the suggested default settings when you run the installer. If you have a Mac, you can install it by opening the terminal program (click on your applications and type \u0026lsquo;terminal\u0026rsquo; in the search window) and then typing in these two commands (or copy and paste). The first command starts at the / and ends at the \u0026quot; and you must include the entire line from slash to closing quotation mark:  /bin/bash -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\u0026quot; and when that finishes,\nbrew install git Make a new directory on your computer with the same name as the repo you created above. For my screenshotted example above, that would be week-two. On a PC, find the folder in your file explorer; click on it so that\u0026rsquo;s the folder displayed in the address bar at the top of the explorer. Then, click in the address bar and type cmd and hit enter. This will open a command prompt window for that folder, allowing you to type commands in directly. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard \u0026gt; Shortcuts \u0026gt; Services. Look for \u0026lsquo;New Terminal at Folder\u0026rsquo; and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select \u0026lsquo;open Terminal here\u0026rsquo;.  A Quick Primer for Working at the Command Line or Terminal\nThe following two videos, one for PC, one for Mac, show you how to do this. For reference\u0026rsquo;s sake, this is what \u0026lsquo;working at the command prompt\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;working at the terminal\u0026rsquo; look like on your machine. When you interact with your computer, you can do it through a graphical interface - icons, clicks, etc - or you can directly type in commands. It\u0026rsquo;s this latter kind of interaction that most people think of as \u0026lsquo;coding\u0026rsquo;, but for us, this is just \u0026lsquo;opening the hood\u0026rsquo;.\n PC:\n  Mac:\n  Key commands for PC:\n dir show the contents of the current directory cls clear the window so that it\u0026rsquo;s fresh again cd directory-name change director to the named directory cd .. change directory up one level if you hit the up or down arrows you can cycle through the history of commands you\u0026rsquo;ve already typed  Key commands for Mac:\n ls list the contents of the current directory pwd print the path (location) of the current directory cd directory-name change director to the named directory cd .. change directory up one level history prints out the entire history of commands you\u0026rsquo;ve typed this session up and down arrows will cycle through this list  Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says ...or create a new repository on the command line? With your command prompt or terminal open in the appropriate folder on your machine (remember, folders on your machine = repos on github), type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with echo), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. If the command works, you\u0026rsquo;ll just be presented with the next prompt. The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report. (nb Git might prompt you to enter your email and name, as it does in the PC video, the first time you ever do this).  Ta da! You can now go to github.com\\\u0026lt;your-user-name\u0026gt;\\your-repo and you\u0026rsquo;ll see it all there tickety boo.\nMaking a new text file on Github You can make a new text file by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;create new file\u0026rsquo; button; remember to always use .md as the file extension. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using markdown conventions\nThe two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.\n  Uploading a file into Github You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.\n  Going further Github can also be used to run an entire website, generated from your text files. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s how I built this course website! The following three links are from my HIST4806a 2020 seminar on digital history and museums; they will walk you through how to use your Github account to serve up a professional scholarly website; you can use this scholarly website to host your reflections and course work, if you want.

I\u0026rsquo;m asking you to start with the easier ones, and then push yourself to try the others. Spatial archaeology looks at the patterning of the remains of human activity in (usually geographic) space over time. It can encompass working with geographic information systems, and it can encompass web mapping (on which see ODATE 3.5). A geographic information system is a way of stacking a series of maps of the same region that contain different kinds of information. Perhaps one layer is a map of soils. Another might be information on slope (steepness) or aspect (direction the slope faces). Another layer might have information on the relative fertility of the soil. To this stack we might add distribution maps of human activity for a given period (perhaps scatters of pottery). The power of GIS lies in its ability to query the ways these different layers might intersect. How does human activity 3000 years ago in the area intersect with the fertility of the soil, and the aspect of the hills? Is there a preference for one kind of landscape rather than another? If we imagine people stood 1.8 m tall, and there\u0026rsquo;s no vegetation in the way, what might they have been able to see?\nBurials at Linlithgow (Python) Dr. Rachel Optiz is a digital archaeologist and landscape archaeologist at the University of Glasgow. She has made a series of computational notebooks for her Archaeology of Scotland class exploring some of the ways we might query spatial data and maps in the Python programming language. Right-click on the link below to launch her binder:\nhttps://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ropitz/spatialarchaeology/master\nAnd then select the linlithgow_spatial.ipynb file, and work through that. (Remember, you select the first cell in the document, then hit run. Wait for it to finish - it\u0026rsquo;ll have an * in it when running, replacing with a sequential number when finished). This notebook explores looking at spatial relationships at a small scale - within a group of Medieval burials from the Carmelite Monastery at Linlithgow.\nYou might get an error towards the end to the effect that something called descartes is not installed. To fix this, click the + to create a new cell. Then, put the following code in the cell:\n!pip install descartes\nand then hit the run button.\n It is possible to just continue without correcting that one particular error.\nBut now, let\u0026rsquo;s turn to a bit larger scale. While the previous work was done in the Python language, this next one will use R.\nExploring a landscape (R). Daniel Contreras has a chapter in Ben Marwick\u0026rsquo;s online book, \u0026lsquo;How To do Archaeological Science in R\u0026rsquo; about using R as a GIS. We\u0026rsquo;re going to follow along with that chapter, but I have modified the code slightly so that it will run in a virtual computer in your browser, using the coding environment R Studio and the language R.\n  Launch a virtual computer running RStudio in your browser by right-clicking on this link\n  The interface for RStudio looks like this:\n  Create a new script:  The dem-gis.R script that you want can be found at this link. Right-click and \u0026lsquo;save-as\u0026rsquo; that file. Use your text editor to open it, then highlight and copy all of the text. In the version of R Studio that is open in your browser, paste the text in the script panel in R Studio.  Now you can run the script. Put the cursor at the top of the file at the start of the line. You can then run each line by hitting the \u0026lsquo;run\u0026rsquo; button, or by using the keyboard shortcut (cmd+enter or shift+enter). Read the comments (which are marked with a # sign) and follow all instructions.\nWork your way through Contreras\u0026rsquo; tutorial, using the dem-gis.R code.\nNow, the advantages to using R or Python to do this kind of work lies in the idea of reproducibility. You can see every step in the reshaping of the data, in the filtering and layering.\nMany archaeologists use the open source QGIS program to work with their data, which provides a visual graphical user interface. It\u0026rsquo;s a very powerful piece of software, and does allow scripting and other interactions. The problem with software-via-a-GUI is that it becomes very hard to reproduce exactly the sequences of clicks and so on that a person uses. Nevertheless, if mapping intrigues you, you should play with it. An excellent guide, \u0026lsquo;QGIS for Archaeologists - Getting Started\u0026rsquo; in the BAJR Practical Guide Series by Jake Streatfeild-James (2016) is at http://www.bajr.org/BAJRGuides/42_QGIS_StarterGuide/42_BAJR_Guide_QGIS.pdf. (By the way, many archaeologists use commercial projects from Esri to handle their spatial data; if you find data files ending with .shp, a \u0026lsquo;shape file\u0026rsquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s an Esri readable format and indeed, the industry standard.)\nIf you really want to get into QGIS, then QGIS4Arch is for you, a series of videos by Ed Gonzalez-Tennant.\n","description":"GIS and webmapping are a bit different","id":44,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Spatial Archaeology","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/3/spatial-archae/"},{"content":"Transcript of this week\u0026rsquo;s episode.\nPart One ","description":"","id":45,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"The One with the Exit Ticket","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/transcripts/exit-ticket-episode/"},{"content":"   While watching this video, turn on the closed captions.\nCreate an account at hypothes.is:\nGet the Chrome app or the Firefox bookmarklet:\nMake sure you\u0026rsquo;re logged in:\nThen join our HIST3000|CLCV3000 reading group.

Everything I read, everything I study. I use Zotero to handle bibliography and to push pdfs to an iPad with zotfile; then I annotate as I read on the device, and eventually, retrieve the annotations back into Zotero.\nI read on a browser on my work computer too; I use hypothes.is with a private group where I\u0026rsquo;m the only member to annotate websites and pdfs when I can\u0026rsquo;t be bothered to send them to the ipad.\nI use a notebook where I scribble out ideas and page numbers.\nAll of this material is scattered around. I\u0026rsquo;ve long admired the work of Caleb McDaniel, and his open notebook history. His research lives online, in a kind of wiki. Links between ideas and observations can be made that way and eventually, ideas can emerge out of the notes themselves by virtue of the way they\u0026rsquo;re connected. This is the idea behind what is called the Zettelkasten Method (\u0026lsquo;slip box\u0026rsquo;, where each idea, each observation is kept on a discrete slip of paper numbered in such a way that connections can be formed):\n A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.\n On a computer, such a thing can be created out of a folder of simple text files. Everything I observe, every idea that I have: one idea, one file. Then I use the free \u0026lsquo;second brain\u0026rsquo; software, Obsidian to sit \u0026lsquo;on top\u0026rsquo; of that stack of files to enable easy linking and discoverability. Obsidian works as a personal knowledge base; seeing your notes develop and beging to interlink - and being able to search those patterns - supercharges your note taking abilities and the value of your reading. With time, you\u0026rsquo;ll start to see connections and patterns in your thoughts. You\u0026rsquo;re building up a personal knowledge base that becomes more valuable the more you use it.\nI have a vault with over 400 notes in it. When I get an idea, I search my vault for relevant notes, and then embed them into a new document. I write around the existing notes, and then export to word for final polishing, citations. This accelerates my writing considerably, and helps me pull my research together into coherent form\nThe point of using Obsidian in this course is that it will enable you to pull your hypothesis annotations together with all of the notes you take as you progress through this course. The key feature of Obsidian is the idea of linking ideas together: maybe it\u0026rsquo;s better to think of it like a personal wiki. The more notes you make, the more connections you start to see, the deeper your learning and engagement with the material.\nYou will notice throughout the weeks I talk about putting something into your journal; this is the tool that you will use for that. You may also use this tool for your consolidation documents. Frankly, I\u0026rsquo;d be delighted to see you use this tool for all of your notetaking, in every course.\r   Download and install Obsidian. It\u0026rsquo;s free; it also comes with mobile versions.\n  Then download and unzip my Digiarch Lab Notebook. Put this somewhere sensible on your computer.\n  Open Obsidian, and explore the default \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; vault. An important thing to know: the notes are all written in markdown, but somethings you have to hit the note \u0026lsquo;preview\u0026rsquo; button to see what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Hit the note\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;pencil\u0026rsquo; icon to get back to editing. The \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; vault will give you a sense of how Obsidian works. ctrl / cmd + e will switch back and forth between \u0026lsquo;preview\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;edit\u0026rsquo;\n  When you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with the interface, click the vault icon to open a new vault; find where you put it and select the \u0026lsquo;Digiarch Lab Notebook\u0026rsquo;. A \u0026lsquo;vault\u0026rsquo; is just what Obsidian calls a folder where your notes are found.  select a different vault\nNote that I have the vault opened in the \u0026lsquo;preview mode\u0026rsquo;. Note also the file explorer at left.\nThe same \u0026lsquo;vault\u0026rsquo; opened in my computer\u0026rsquo;s finder/file explorer. Any note I make here can be copied to somewhere else.\n When the warning popup about community plugins \u0026amp; safe mode appears, turn safe mode OFF; if the settings pop-up opens, just hit the \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; button to close it. You\u0026rsquo;re now good to go!\n  As you try the various tutorials in this class, you can also keep notes via Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;daily note\u0026rsquo; feature; this might be handy! Hit the \u0026lsquo;view daily note\u0026rsquo; button in the toolbar to make your first note. This can be just a simple \u0026lsquo;hey, this is a note\u0026rsquo;.\n  You can do the same thing for a log file.\nMake a new github repository just for your work in this class; configure it with a readme (if you make it private you\u0026rsquo;ll please add me as a collaborator). Once it\u0026rsquo;s created, drag and drop your journal and log files for a given week into the repository, as appropriate. Commit your changes.  There\u0026rsquo;s your note. You can drag-and-drop it into a github.com repository.\nWhenever I ask, for the duration of the course, for a journal entry, you can make it using Obsidian, then copy the file to your repository, and provide me the link to the file. Ditto for the log file.  As you progress through the course, take the time to spot connections between your different notes and journal entries. Use [[ and ]] to connect keywords in your notes to other notes. With time, you\u0026rsquo;ll start to \u0026lsquo;connect your thinking\u0026rsquo; and this will make it easier for you to see how your understanding is growing, changing, and becoming more sophisticated. Indeed, if you wanted, I would encourage you to put all your notes from all your classes into Obsidian, and look for those interlinkages. It will be transformative!\r Not required but maybe helpful: This vault comes with a \u0026lsquo;complex template\u0026rsquo; for retrieving annotations from the web made with hypothesis. To use this complex template, make a new empty note and then select the \u0026lt;% from the tool ribbon. In the pop-up select \u0026lsquo;hypothesis\u0026rsquo;. The first time you do this, the template will ask you to insert your \u0026lsquo;hypothes.is user token\u0026rsquo;. You can find this by being logged into the hypothes.is website, and then going to https://hypothes.is/account/developer and finding the token on your user page - it looks like a long string of gibberish. Paste this in to the pop-up box in Obsidian. (You only have to do this the first time. This token gives Obsidian permission to query Hypothesis for your annotations). Then, Obsidian will ask you for the URL of the page you wish to extract annotations from. Insert the full address et voilà. A new note with your annotation!  (By the way, a vault with many more bells-and-whistles crafted especially for history students is available here and you\u0026rsquo;re welcome to give it a try too. This vault is configured with plugins to make it easy to import zotero notes and bibliography. It has a template to go out and grab your hypothesis annotations. It has a template to create timelines from notes that detail events. If you drop an image file into the vault, it has a template to do OCR on that image and paste the resulting text into a new note. There are tools in there to help you find connections between your notes; one of them will examine your note and then use some text analysis to find related notes based on the text. My gift to you.)\n","description":"No one teaches us how to take notes effectively online.

But you can get the feed for the podcast here.\nDo You may make your repository private or public.\nIf you make it private, make sure to \u0026lsquo;invite user shawngraham\u0026rsquo; to your repository so that I may view it. (See the Github instructions for a reminder.)\n Create a short consolidation document that reflects on this third module and your growth (one or two pages is fine). Feel free to build it from what you\u0026rsquo;ve already written in your logs.  Discuss at least one \u0026lsquo;fail\u0026rsquo; and one \u0026lsquo;win\u0026rsquo;.

Are there new dilemmas that have emerged?\nIntegrate my feedback on your earlier work or any feedback you have received from your peers, summarizing the work you have done to date.\n Upload this to your github repository.  Submit Work for Grading You can log the link to your repository on this form.\nA Choice re Consolidation III and the Exit Ticket Recognizing the grind that we are all in as the term winds down, and knowing that Covid-19 is still a factor in our lives, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided that we can afford a choice as we hurtle towards the end of term.\nThere are two graded assignments left - consolidation doc III and the exit ticket. Of these, the exit ticket is imagined as a kind of consolidation of the consolidations, and a chance for you to argue for a final grade if you so desire to do (perhaps sickness or other issues meant that your earlier work doesn\u0026rsquo;t accurately reflect what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned, etc). Those two documents are each worth 25% of your final grade.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking:\nOption A: you complete the consolidation doc III AND the Exit Ticket as laid out in the syllabus. 25% and 25%. Consolidation doc III is due at the end of week 12; the exit ticket will be due at the end of the following week.\nOption B: you complete JUST the consolidation doc III addressing the prompts as fully and explicitly as you can AND you add a section discussing the overall evolution of your thought in the course (with explicit reference to your earlier work, links, and citations to readings as appropriate). If you choose this option, the weightings of your three consolidation documents will be 33 1/3% each, and the ability to argue for your own overall grade in the course will be off the table. I will accept Option B work as late as December 17.\nYou will indicate which option you are pursuing with a statement in the first line of Consolidation Doc III.\n","description":"Consolidation III","id":50,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"M3 Wk12: Instructions","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/12/instructions/"},{"content":"Building a website from scratch can be onerous. Using a system like Wordpress or Squarespace etc can leave you locked in to someone else\u0026rsquo;s platform (and any security issues that might entail).\nHere, we\u0026rsquo;re going to build a simple website that uses nothing but text files as its source; these text files will always be readable into the future, and you can also copy them to your own machine so that they\u0026rsquo;re always handy, ready to be transformed into something else.\nI\u0026rsquo;m talking about static site building; there are many different generators out there that will take your text files, pump them through some templates, and spit out flat html on the other side. At The Programming Historian, there is a lesson by Amanda Visconti on using Jekyll and Github Pages to make a site; we\u0026rsquo;re going to do something much easier.\nIn essence, you are going to create a new repository in your Github account called your-username.github.io and it will be set to public when you make it; initialize with a readme.md. Then, add a new file in there called index.md and you\u0026rsquo;re going to write something in that file, eg,\n## My Quick Static Site This is a site I build with gh-pages. **Wow** It reads [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and turns it into html. ![gif ftw](https://media.giphy.com/media/nXxOjZrbnbRxS/200w_d.gif) Commit that file. Then, hit the gear wheel icon (the settings) and scroll down to the Github Pages section. Github will run your text files through the Jekyll site builder for you; here you can select from some of their templates.\nBoom! The full process is on this site with screenshots.\nContent Now, consider how you want to explain your work so far in this course on the graveyard project. You might want to create some subpages; just make these in your repo as text files ending in .md. When Github builds your page, it will add these to the navigation. Put images in the same folder, and then you can link to them with ![al-text describing the image](image-filename.png) (or .jpg, right? Depends on the filename?).\nThe layout and so on is probably not going to be perfectly what you want. There will be time enough to fiddle with this, and there are any number of tutorials out there on customizing a gh-pages simple site. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about that right now. Think of your content first, for this week.\nGoing Further Now, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more to static websites than this. This course site is generated with Hugo; a site generator for building exhibitions, called \u0026lsquo;Wax\u0026rsquo;, is available here. (Speaking of exhibits, here\u0026rsquo;s information about building them with Omeka.net.)\n","description":"Building a fast and secure site","id":51,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Static Websites","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/10/static-websites/"},{"content":"\nHIST3000|CLCV3000 Fall 2021 Department of History, Carleton University Once the excavation is over, what happens to the information created through archaeological research? How do archaeologists use digital technologies on site, in the lab, or on the web? This course explores the intersection of digital technologies and computing with archaeology. We will explore the ways theory gets embedded into computation; perhaps there is even a theory of digital archaeology? We will explore how digital technologies allow us to ask questions that would otherwise be impossible to ask. We will consider the ethical ramifications of our digital tools and opaque algorithms. We will also look into the ways that computational creativity in archaeology allow for novel engagements with the past, thus moving us into a digital public archaeology.\nYou do not need to be \u0026lsquo;techy\u0026rsquo; to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open. You will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including Hypothes.is and Github (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. Successful completion of this class involves doing a series of exercises each week designed to push you out of your comfort zone, AND to be a collegial and generous scholar engaging with, and helping your peers to achieve success. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. Again: You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.\nThe Most Important Idea Archaeology\u0026rsquo;s genesis was in racism, and colonialism.\nDigital technology\u0026rsquo;s birth was in the violence of war, and the control of systems.\nIf you put those two things together without taking into account the implications then we\u0026rsquo;re in for a lot of trouble.\nSo what I want to know is, can digital archaeology be taught, be learned, be practiced, in such a way that we unpick those two trajectories, those two monstrous births, and use digital archaeology to better understand communities, empower people, and give better, more compelling, more truthful stories about what it means to be human?\nArchaeology isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily about the past. It\u0026rsquo;s about the materiality of the past and present and in many ways, the future. We try to understand what it is to be human through the extended abilities that tool use, that objects and their agencies, give to us. The digital tools we use and are entangled with extend humanity in powerful ways - and in 2020, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see how digital technologies have extended humanity\u0026rsquo;s worst impulses.\nMy goal here is to teach you to use certain digital techs; to unpack and interrogate those techs you learn to use; and to equip you to use these things in a reflective manner. It\u0026rsquo;s about archaeology using computation; but also, looking at computation from an archaeological perspective. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be uncomfortable. Not only that, this is the first iteration of the course. That makes you my accomplices. There will be things we try here that will not work. That\u0026rsquo;s why part of the exit ticket for this course will be for you to rethink the one part of the course that was most affecting for you to make it better, but also, to think through who it might harm.\nText/Tech To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software.\nWe will be using elements of the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook Environment https://o-date.github.io; we may in fact re-write parts of it as a result of our work, in which case you will be credited as a co-author.\nHaving a reasonably up-to-date computer will make life easier for you; if you use a chromebook or a low-powered laptop (eg, less than 8 gb of RAM), this will require us to think creatively about some of the work, but should not present an insurmountable obstacle. A good internet connection will make life easier, but I realize that not everyone is well-served by our tech oligopolies. Please let me know if these situations apply to you so that we can work out a suitable plan of action.\nClass format This class will be delivered online, asynchronously. A Discord server will be used to provide a social context to our work, for help, and for collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on this open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. There will be no required synchronous chats or lectures. Students will maintain course research notebooks on the web (which may be anonymous or pseudonymous or made private provided access is shared with me).\nWhy? I\u0026rsquo;ve taught online for a variety of institutions, using a variety of formats and approaches. I like teaching asnchronously because I believe it is a kinder approach to complex topics, especially when there is a second layer of difficulty - basic digital literacy, in this case - which intersects with the content, my learning goals for you, your own personal situations - in ways I cannot always anticipate or know.\nSince I cannot know these things, I do not believe that I should bludgeon you with content; I do not think that \u0026lsquo;rigour\u0026rsquo; is demonstrated by forcing you to join me at set times; I do not believe that face-to-face work is somehow more \u0026lsquo;scholarly\u0026rsquo; than other kinds of work. Right now, with the world the way it is, I want to build a structure that opens possibility space for you to engage with this topic, and with \u0026lsquo;digital archaeology\u0026rsquo; when you encounter it beyond this course, in ways that will push you forward as a scholar and citizen.\nFor this to work well, it requires you to be on the same page as me. There is a lot of flexibility built into this course, but it does require you to try to push yourself out of your comfort zone. The key thing is always to tie what you\u0026rsquo;re doing with what you\u0026rsquo;re reading and what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking. That \u0026lsquo;second layer of difficulty\u0026rsquo; will come with practice. But how it intersects with everything else: that\u0026rsquo;s where the learning happens.\nIt might seem a bit macabre or \u0026lsquo;off\u0026rsquo; somehow to build some of our work around the ways the dead are memorialized in Canadian graveyards, in this time of pandemic (see week two). I wrestled with this. But I settled on doing this for a variety of reasons. One, the simple reason that getting you outside and doing one variety of archaeological work and thinking through how tech intersects with field work and the realities of space is a valuable exercise; two it gives us data that we can work on later as the weather grows colder; and more importantly - three - we don\u0026rsquo;t often talk about death in modern Western culture. Memorialization and its practices can reveal much about past human groups, but in the gaps with our present day, can teach us much about ourselves.\n\u0026hellip;and that is why this course is the way it is. No doubt, things will break, and some things will work better/be more effective than others. We will roll with it.\n","description":"what to tell your friends","id":52,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"1. Course Description","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/docs/1-coursedescription/"},{"content":"Questions I developed this course with a couple of questions in mind, things I wanted to know the answers to. Digital archaeology - what the hell is it, anyway? What is it for? Is it just a \u0026lsquo;follower\u0026rsquo;, repurposing other tools \u0026amp; techniques, a supporting skill for \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; archaeology? Let\u0026rsquo;s set ourselves a grand challenges: what can digital archaeology be?\nThis course is a formalized exploration of these questions; I do not know the answers! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to figure these out with you.\nNb The process of teaching is also a process of collaboration between me and you. This is the first time this course has been taught. Sometimes -and we\u0026rsquo;re expecting this, you and I- things won\u0026rsquo;t work as we expect; tech might break; the world might impinge too much. We will adapt accordingly. Remember: the grade in this course is a function of your process and your evolution, so adapting and thinking through the implications of when things don\u0026rsquo;t go according to plan is, in fact, according to plan. Outcomes The five points below address your analytical ability, your engagement with methodology, collaboration, argumentation, and professionalization.\n Situate the emergence and evolution of digital archaeology within the historiography of archaeology more broadly (analytical ability, argumentation) Implement and contribute to a digital archaeology gravestones\u0026rsquo; and monuments survey (methodology, collaboration, professionalization) Investigate data, artifacts, and primary sources, using the methods/techniques/perspectives of digital archaeology and digital humanities (analytical ability, methodology, collaboration, professionalization) Develop online experiences that communicate the results of these investigations as an act of public digital archaeology (collaboration, professionalization, argumentation) Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital archaeologists collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion. (collaboration, professionalization, methodology)  Texts See the weekly work section. All readings are open access.\nReal Names Policy You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me that you wish to use a pseudonym. It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message:\n‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’\n…where xxxxx is the name you have selected. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.\nWhen Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, I can\u0026rsquo;t help you if I don\u0026rsquo;t know you need help, a breathing space, some direction. When something comes up, just let me know:\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. I trust you.\r When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here. It\u0026rsquo;s our course - we can change things up as we need to. Just put \u0026ldquo;something has come up\u0026rdquo; in the subject line.\nTHIS INCLUDES COVID I fully expect that at some point during the term, COVID and its complications will happen to some of you. When this happens, just email me and say that \u0026ldquo;something has come up\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t require a dr\u0026rsquo;s note, or any of the details. Again, I trust you, and we\u0026rsquo;ll figure something else out.\nSimilarly, I have small children and people in my life who are at risk.

Sometimes there is a choice of which tasks to do; in those cases, I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for the number of these that you complete, but that you push yourself out of your comfort level. What\u0026rsquo;s more, it\u0026rsquo;s OK if something doesn\u0026rsquo;t work \u0026lsquo;perfectly.\u0026rsquo; The reflection on the process, both your fails and your successes, is the important thing.\nWeekly work should be completed and logged by the end of the relevant week. Dr Graham will provide ungraded feedback on this work in order to help you grow. There are three \u0026lsquo;consolidation\u0026rsquo; weeks in the schedule, where you\u0026rsquo;ll prepare a \u0026lsquo;consolidation document\u0026rsquo; that will be graded. Late work can be accepted only through arrangement with Dr. Graham.\nIf you miss a week, or something comes up let Dr. Graham know as soon as possible so that arrangements can be made. I want you to be successful; if something comes up we can adapt accordingly. If you do not let me know, then I cannot help you.\nEvidence for Your Weekly Logs (ungraded work) I am looking for the following kinds of evidence (each week will specify what needs to be done):\n logs/lab notebook entry that keep track of what you actually did reflection on that process engagement with the materials and your classmates (which might be demonstrated many different ways) evidence for your growth as a scholar over this course  At the end of each week by Sunday evening, you will provide to me through a form that can be found on each weekly page the links to your evidence for me to consider.\nI will return feedback to you within two or three days. I will write you a short note giving you my perspective on what you\u0026rsquo;ve done (using the lens of the learning outcomes), and offering advice. This weekly work is to help you grow. It is not formally assigned a grade, but it does provide evidence of your growth against the learning outcomes, and your engagement with it does play into your eventual final grade.\nIt might not be formally \u0026lsquo;graded\u0026rsquo; weekly work. But it does count towards your grade, especially when you need to point to the evidence supporting your consolidation work or your exit ticket. So it matters that you do this conscientiously.\r Consolidation Weeks (graded work) Every fourth week (that is, at the end of each module) you will submit a \u0026lsquo;consolidation document\u0026rsquo;. Consolidation weeks give you the space to try something again, or finish doing something that you had to put aside earlier. This document is where you can show me that you\u0026rsquo;ve taken my feedback and considered it and adapted/adopted accordingly. These are short documents; they can reuse materials (suitably edited) from your journal and note entries. Show evidence by linking to your repository materials. I would like you to suggest an overall grade for the module for you, based on how your work matches up against the learning outcomes for the course (see \u0026lsquo;grading\u0026rsquo; below).\n Module 1 consolidation document: due at the end of week four; may be submitted in the following week if you notify me in week four. Module 2 consolidation document: due at the end of week eight; may be submitted in the following week if you notify me in week eight. Module 3 consolidation document: due at the end of week twelve; may be submitted in the following week if you notify me in week twelve.  Do not attempt to speedrun this course. By \u0026lsquo;speedrun\u0026rsquo; I mean, you leave it until the end and try to do all of the work in one intense session. Work done in that fashion cannot, by virtue of it all being dumped in my lap at the end of the course, take into account feedback, peer collaboration, or have any meaningful engagement with the materials. Thus, work done in this fashion cannot meet the learning goals of the course, with negative implications for your grade. Do not do this. The Exit Ticket You will produce an \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; for me at the end of the course (open format) reflecting on where you started and where you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you\u0026rsquo;ve done against the learning outcomes. You are required to explicitly tie your exit ticket to evidence collected in your weekly work. The exit ticket is a summary assessment exercise that will pull all the different strings together into a strong cord. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s journey is different. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never done digital work before, it might be that you never quite manage to get as many of the tech things working as you might\u0026rsquo;ve wanted: but you now know what you didn\u0026rsquo;t know before. That\u0026rsquo;s a win. You might be a computer science minor and the tech materials don\u0026rsquo;t present you with much challenge: but figuring out how to tell the compelling story was very difficult for you but you\u0026rsquo;re better at it now. Your \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; will explain to me your particular context, and it will point to the evidence that demonstrates how you\u0026rsquo;ve moved along from where you were at the beginning to where you are now.\nIf I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive (thus, you have the opportunity to override the percentage breakdowns below).\nWhen I have disagreed in previous courses this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to raise the grade: y\u0026rsquo;all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you\u0026rsquo;ve overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - we would talk and come to an agreement.\nThe Exit Ticket should be submitted within one week of the last day of the fall term.\nGrading Remembering the learning outcomes,\n   Learning Outcome A B C D eg. Jo Q Student     1. analytical ability - - - - X   2. methodology - - - - -   3. collaboration - - - - X   4. argumentation - - - - X   5. professionalization - - - - -    \u0026hellip;5/5 would be an A, 4/5 would be a B, 3/5 would be a C, 2/5 a D.\nIn this example, based on my consideration of Jo Q Student\u0026rsquo;s evidence and the feedback I\u0026rsquo;d written her over the six weeks, it seemed to me that she did what she needed to do (satisfactorily) for 3 out of the 5 outcomes and so earned a C. However, her exit ticket might bring her up. Percentage Breakdown I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown.\nConsolidation documents = 75%\nFinal Exit ticket = 25%\nI reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student.\n","description":"grading and ungrading","id":55,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"4.

Rather, I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of method and thought that will help you with your research goals. A big part of that is trying to teach how to deal with what might feel like \u0026lsquo;failure\u0026rsquo;, on first blush. I want you to swing for the bleachers, and not to be afraid of whiffing on the ball. After all, to mix sporting metaphors, you\u0026rsquo;re here for icetime not the Stanley Cup.\nOn another note, this course originally was intended to be a kind of hybrid course, blending face to face work in the classroom with resources and digital tools.\nThat of course, can\u0026rsquo;t happen at the moment.\nMoving online just means that I have to work harder at fostering the social aspect of learning and education.\nSocial Contact Another problem with moving fully online is isolation. Working with digital tools and environments, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re not overly familiar with how they work - or even the underlying metaphors that would help you make sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on - is frustrating. Bad enough when you have classmates you see twice a week and can at least complain with over coffee later; extremely awful when you\u0026rsquo;re on a bad internet connection and everyone thinks that you\u0026rsquo;re not really doing schoolwork.\nIn past classes, I have used Slack as a way of trying to meet that need for human connection that makes learning meaningful. It worked, more or less, but if there was a conversation going on and you missed part of it, it could just feel overwhelming and impenetrable.\nAnd it was one more damned thing to install. One more damned thing to get a password for.\nI tried Zulipchat another year. Same problem again.\nThis year, as I write this, I\u0026rsquo;m trying Discord, for its voice and screensharing integration. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes.\nDigital Archaeology is a team sport. You are never expected to power through all of this material on your own in heroic scholarly endeavour. If you need help, ask for help; if you can help, offer it. You are not alone.\r This website is built using Hugo, a static site builder. Static sites are quicker, more secure, and separate content from container, thus making them more sustainable. I write all of the content in individual text files, which I can then turn into whatever output - html, pdf, word doc - that I need. My writing is freed from subscription-based software that might lock it in. I push all of the text files onto github (you can see them here.) Then, I have netlify.com watch those files for any changes. When it spots changes, it uses Hugo to turn them into html, and serves them up to the world.\nI am grateful to Chantal Brousseau, who did a road-test of this entire site, checking for dead links and so on, before we went live in September.\nThe course logo is by user \u0026lsquo;corpus delicti\u0026rsquo;, at The Noun Project.\n","description":"how the course tech is built; how the course came to be","id":60,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"7.

Instructions will seem vague or incomplete - or worse, I will have indeed forgotten to tell you something crucial.\nOr worse, I\u0026rsquo;ve made an assumption about your understanding, and left things unsaid that needed to be made explicit. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of this, in the digital world, in fact.\nThis week, you learned a bit about Git and Github. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at a question on the q-and-a site, \u0026lsquo;Stackoverflow\u0026rsquo; here. Just scroll through that question, and look at some of the answers. Make a note of any terms or code or responses that make not an ounce of sense to you.\nIt can make you feel rather overwhelmed, rather quickly. And like most places on the internet, StackOverflow has its own culture, its own norms of expression and behaviour. People who are new can get roasted. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons we have our own discord server, and a private reading group on Hypothesis: these are places for you to ask for help from a community that understands where you\u0026rsquo;re coming from because we\u0026rsquo;re all in the same headspace.\nSo, when things go wrong, the first thing to do is to find the community that understands where you\u0026rsquo;re coming from. I read and search StackOverflow all the time, but I rarely ask questions there. Instead, I write to trusted colleagues. And they in turn write to me.\nBut there are a couple of things we can do to make life easier.\nAsking good questions StackOverflow does have good advice on asking good questions. I will excerpt some of their advice:\n Write a title that summarizes the specific problem\u0026hellip; If you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title last - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.\n  Introduce the problem before you post any code [or a screenshot or a video clip]\u0026hellip;start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. Explain how you encountered the problem you\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself.\n  Help others reproduce the problem [SG: post the code, post a screenshot, post a video clip walk through]\n Please do this.\nEvery term, I receive dozens of emails with the subject line \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; and the message body \u0026lsquo;i tried it and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo;. Sometimes, the message will also say \u0026lsquo;i worked on it for 3 hrs and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo;.\nNone of that is helpful. Telling me that you worked on it for 3 hours just shows me that you ignored my messages about \u0026lsquo;if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come after 30 minutes, take a break, ask for help\u0026rsquo;.\nCollect all of the information together, put it in a file in your repo, and share the link in discord or post the whole thing in the relevant channel.\nPlease, PLEASE, don\u0026rsquo;t just post something that says, \u0026lsquo;it didn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo; and then leave it at that. What\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;it\u0026rsquo;? What were you expecting to happen? What did you try? Show me\u0026hellip;\nAnswering questions As the course progresses, you will have many opportunities to ask for help from me and from your peers - post these in our discord server in the appropriate channel.\nSometimes, you will see questions that you can answer. A few guidelines for answering questions:\n There are many different ways to solve these issues; someone might post a different way but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that either of you are necessarily wrong. Read the question carefully. Request clarification if there are bits that the original poster didn\u0026rsquo;t make clear - help them to ask better questions. Use screenshots and screenvideo (I find screencastomatic handy in this regard) to show how things worked for you. Provide links to useful relevant material if you know of it. Assume the best of everyone: not everyone has the same fluency with these machines, and it takes a while to learn the language.  Answering the questions of your peers, helping them out, is an excellent way to meet one of the course outcomes.\n","description":"Learn to ask good questions to make life easier.","id":62,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Asking for help","uri":"https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/1/help/"},{"content":"Click title to see the full Post\nLorem est tota propiore conpellat pectoribus de\npectora summo.
