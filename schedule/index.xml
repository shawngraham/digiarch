      <description>Each week, I will lay out goals for things I want you to pay attention to, I will give you something to listen to, and I will give you things to read, and things to do.&#xA;Goals for this week This week is about getting set up and situated, including using a custom platform I have built for note-making. You might already have a system you use for making notes and keeping track of things, which is good.</description>
